            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>This Pilgrime being drawn with a great deſire to preſent himſelfe, and his ſeruice to your Maieſty, was driuen backe by a double feare: the one, of offending
<pb facs="tcp:16410:3"/> with his ouer-boldnes, in preſenting himſelfe (poore Pilgrime) to ſo great a Princeſſe: the other, leaſt the very name of Pilgrime might debar him of all acceſſe, and Audience.

            <p>For the honours, and glory of this mortal life, your Maieſty hath as much, as your heart can reaſonably deſire: You haue for your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours great Emperours, and Kings of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary and Bohemia; for your Progenitors, the great Dukes of Tuſcany; for your Father, Great <hi>Henry</hi> of France; and for your husband, the King of Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> all Great.

            <p>Theſe, <hi>MADAME,</hi> are holy vertues which adorne noble &amp; deuout ſoules, as ſilke, ſiluer, gold, pearles, and precious ſtones doe the body: theſe are the ornaments which haue aduanced meane women aboue Queenes, &amp; Queenes aboue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues; as they did <hi>Hester,</hi> who though ſhe were exceeding beautifull, yet her humility, modeſty, charity, wiſedome &amp; other diuine qualities of her ſoule, made her more admired in her life, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beauty of her body, or the Diademe of her head; and after her death, hath left her Name grauen in the memory of all following ages.</p>

               <p>BVT wherefore (will ſome ſay) was it ſo often remoued within Chriſtendome? This demand may be pertinent, becauſe it is profitable; and it may be curious alſo, for that we muſt admire and prayſe the workes of God, rather then ſearch the cauſes, which cannot be but iuſt. Notwithſtanding we anſwere with reſpect and humility, that the ſame power, which remoued that heauenly houſe from amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, cauſing it to be caried aboue 500. leagues, could at the firſt haue placed it where it ſhould remayne, and where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth at this tyme; but that it rather pleaſed his diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence to doe, as he hath done, and to make his worke more certaine and admirable by ſuch changes and remoues.

               <p>I was at <hi>Auinion</hi> the yeare of our Lord 1590. when a little child of the ſame towne aboute fiue or ſix yeares old,<note place="margin">A child fell from a place 24. foote high without harme 1590.</note> named <hi>George Caluet,</hi> the ſonne of a worſhipfull Aduocate, going to ſee the ſchollers proceſſion at the Church of our B Lady of Guifts, fell from the platforme which is before the ſayd Church about 24. foot high vpon the ſtones; they that ſaw him in the aire when he fell, &amp; they that tooke him vp from the ground, thought ſurely he had beene all cruſhed and bruiſed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wrapped him quickly in a Sheepe skinne, they found at the laſt, that he had no harme at all, and the next morning he was to the proceſſion, ſound &amp; liuely, to giue thankes to God and our B.

This happened in a publicke place, and the chance was great and ſtrange, and yet marked but by a few: for the Poſt of Auinion comming to Lions but ſome moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſeeing this in print, denyed ſtoutly that any ſuch thing had happened there, and his denyall had preuailed againſt the truth, if there had not beene ſome there, that were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes thereof.

This conſtant deuotion of ſuch perſons, is an euident proofe, that this place is the ſame we beleeue it to be; and ſo much the more aſſured, in that this holy Sea hath alwayes beene diligent and curious to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the truth of like euents, and to reiect and condemne all ſuperſtition and lyes in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>To theſe teſtimonyes we may add reaſons to confirme the ſame; for firſt it ſeemeth impoſſible, that it ſhould come by the fantaſy of men to haue found the meanes of this tranſport, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without example both before and after. For though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers thinges haue beene heeretofore tranſported, as we haue ſhewed before, yet neuer was it heard of any whole entire houſe or building.</p>
               <p>Therefore as any ſuch like thing was neuer heard of, ſo neither could it (ſpeaking morally) enter into the thought of any man to fayne or deuiſe, or to further it, if it were not true. Neither yet being true, could it be receaued &amp; acknowledged by the world, if it were not reuealed &amp; made manifeſt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary meanes, as hath beene ſayd.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what could men promiſe to themſelues or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of this inuention, of ſo ſmall aſſurance, not only in the truth, but alſo in the apparence of probability, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and ſhame when it ſhould be diſcouered and found falſe, which muſt needes haue happened quickly?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the thing were falſe, how could it be done, that none ſhould percaue it? Or if they did perceaue it, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16410:20"/> none did contradict it? But cleane contrary all people of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and conſcience, that haue written ſince, haue ſpoken in the confirmation of this common beliefe, none being found but only theſe deceaued people, who with Luther, without reaſon haue oppoſed themſelues thereunto, as well as vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles of the Catholike faith, and that ſo much the more obſtinatly, by how much the more they haue conſpired to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit &amp; contradict all that concerneth the honour of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, ſuch as this hiſtory is.</p>

               <p>The wretched misbelieuer, who draweth poiſon out of all this good iuice, and turneth light into darkenes, will ſay, that this was the marke wherat the couetouſnes of Prieſts did ſhoot, and that to obtaine that, they haue ſo much preached &amp; magnifyed this place, drawing thither all the world by affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted commendations: but the faythfull which haue eyes to ſee the workes of God, doe acknowledge the treaſures of his heauenly bleſſing, hauing by the meanes of this ſacred Houſe brought aboundance of all good, as heeretofore to the houſe of <hi>Obededom,</hi> by the preſence of the Arke of Teſtament,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 6.</note> not for to fill the auarice of the Prieſts, but for his owne glory, &amp; for the ornament of his houſe, and for the maintenance of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and of the poore, for all which there is ſpent euery yeare 30000.

It is good reaſon then to learne the manner of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well. It appeareth by the foreſayd definitions, that the eſſence and foundation of true prayer conſiſteth in the ſoule; that which is made with the mouth and voice only, deſerueth not the name of prayer. It is the language of a Parrot that ſpeaketh it knoweth not what. Prayer of the ſpirit, ſpeaketh properly to God, and maketh himſelfe to be vnderſtood as an Angell, though the lips ſtirre not, and he cryeth aloud to God in profound ſilence.<note place="margin">

The inward is the roote and fruit of deuotion, the outward is the flowre and budd. To doe it well, he muſt learne to meditate well; for meditarion, and contemplation do illuminate the vnderſtanding, do heat the wil, eleuate the ſoule to God, and ioyneth it to his loue, which is the very
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16410:34"/> eſſence and vigour of prayer: Fire is kindled in my meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſayth <hi>Dauid,</hi>) that is to ſay, My prayer ſhall be feruent, if I meditate well.</p>
               <p>To meditate Chriſtian-like, is to diſcourſe in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſome diuine ſubiect, of the creation of the world, of the Natiuity of the Sonne of God, of his death, of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, of the purity and humility of the B. Virgin Mary, of ſome vertue or vice, of death, iudgement, hell, heauen, and ſuch like matters. This diſcourſe is made in noting the cauſes,<note place="margin">The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Prayer.</note> and effects, and deducing concluſions agreable to the honour of God, and our good. For example, meditating of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, I obſerue, that God is the ſupreme cauſe of all thinges, who hath made all of nothing by his only word, that heauen and all the creatures with them are the workes of his power, wiſedome, and bounty; heereof I conclude,<note place="margin">Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> that he is almighty, hauing brought forth ſuch goodly effects of nothing; all wiſe, hauing ſo diuinely ordered them; all good in hauing giuen them all to men; againe I conclude, that I am bound to feare him as my ſoueraigne Lord, adore him as the ſupreme wiſedome, and loue him as the infinite bounty, and to ſerue him with all my hart, and with all my forces, as my Creatour, my King, my Maker, my Father, and my all in all. By this diſcourſe, my vnderſtanding is delighted in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous workes of God, my will is warmed in his loue, and of them both my ſoule taketh a tongue to ſpeake vnto him, and maketh her prayer, adoring his greatnes, admyring his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, magnifying his bounty, caſting her ſelfe into the armes of his holy prouidence; declaring her infirmityes, offering her abilityes, her vowes, teares, ſighes, and deſires, and al that ſhe hath, demanding what ſhe hath not, perfect humility, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, patience, charity, and other vertues; and finally drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her ſelfe in praying to this ſupreme Deity, as before ſhe did in meditating. Contemplation is a regard of the eyes of the ſoule faſtened attentiuely vpon ſome obiect,<note place="margin">Definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> as if after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing meditated of the creation, ſhe ſhould ſet her eye of her vnderſtanding faſt and fixed vpon the greatnes of God, vpon the beauty of the Heauens; or hauing diſcourſed of the paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Sauiour, ſhe behouldeth him preſent, &amp; ſeeth him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16410:35"/> and without any other diſcourſe perſeuereth conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this ſpectacle. Then the ſoule doth contemplate vpon her meditation:<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> ſo that contemplation is more then meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as it were the end thereof, and it groweth and ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vpon it many tymes, as the braunch doth vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the tree, or the flowre vpon the branch. For the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding hauing attentiuely, and with many reaſons to and fro meditated the myſtery, and gathered diuers lights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, doth frame vnto her ſelf a cleere knowledge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of without further diſcourſe, one way or other, ſhe enioyeth (as I may ſay) a viſion which approcheth to the knowledge of Angells, who vnderſtand without diſcourſe; although it may ſo happen,<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Angels.</note> that the deuout ſoule may enter into contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without any meditation going before, according as the diuine wiſedome ſhall affoard her inward obiects, after the manner of viſions, as it did often to the Prophets, and his moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friends and ſeruants; or els where the party himſelfe doth chooſe ſome one, where he feeleth greateſt guſt, and there ſtayeth without ſtirring.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: it is as the reading of a booke, which muſt be done ſentence after ſentence; but contemplation is like caſting the eyes vpon a picture, diſcerning all at once. Meditation is like eating: Contemplation like drinking, a worke more ſweet, cooling, and more delicate, leſſe labour, and more pleaſure then eating is. For he that meditateth, taketh an antecedent, doth behould, weigh, and conſider it, as it were ſhewing the meate with ſome paine, and afterward doth gather concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s one after another, as it were ſwallowing downe of morſells, and taketh his pleaſure by peeces; but he that contemplateth, receaueth his obiect without paine ſwiftly, and as it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather, as if he tooke a draught of ſome delicate wine: ſuch is Meditation, and ſuch is Contemplation.

               <p>The cauſe of the firſt is the excellency of man, conſiſting in his ſoule, an immortal or heauenly eſſence, bearing in it ſelf the image and likenes of that ſoueraigne and ſupreme beauty: by reaſon wherof there was due vnto him a perpetual habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more proportionate to his dignity, &amp; a more noble hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe then the earth, a dwelling common to the beaſts alſo, and to the creatures of vileſt and baſeſt condition: yea although he had not ſinned, this baſe world had beene aſſigned vnto him notwithſtanding, as a land of pilgrimage, not painefull and wretched as it is now, but gracious and honourable, where hauing a while delighted himſelfe with the contemplation of his Creatour, and his goodly workes, and in thankeſgiuing for the benefits receaued of that ſupreme bounty, without any death or payne, he ſhould haue mounted with his body, to heauen his true Countrey, there to raigne for euer in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels, his countrey-men and fellow-cittizens. The earth therfore was graunted &amp; giuen vnto him as a dwelling, pleaſant indeed, yet not perpetuall, but only for a tyme, as it were in paſſing, &amp; ſo by reaſon of this preheminence, he was ſtill a Pilgrime, and no Cittizen.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why mans pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage heer is ſo paineful.</note>Now the cauſe why this pilgrimage is ſo painefull, and full of miſeries, is the ſinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> for the which he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of the earthly Paradiſe, and became a poore Bandit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the world; and in him, all his poſterity, and race of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall children were depriued (for the moſt part) of the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16410:43"/> of the world, which was their portion and inheritance: &amp; moreouer for this old fault, and for other new dayly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by themſelues, they are made ſubiect to cold, heat, hunger, thirſt, wearines, want, dangers from men and beaſtes, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers one to another, and enemyes one to another, and finally condemned to a thouſand miſeryes incident to this life, &amp; laſt of all to death, that dolefull cloſe of all our whole pilgrimage, if it be not made in the grace of God.</p>
               <p>The fourth point ſhall be to conſider the courſe of the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage limited with two boundes; our birth, and our death,<note place="margin">4.

               <p>The fifth point ſhall conſider the ſaying of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>

               <p>The ſecond point ſhal conſider, that this honour &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is payed by the fine of the three Theologicall vertues,<note place="margin">How this honour is yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to God.</note> Fayth, Hope, and Charity. By Fayth we belieue, that God is an eſſence infinite, eternall, incomprehenſible, one God in three perſons, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt. God that hath created the world, and gouerneth it with his power, and wiſedome, and hath redeemed it by his bounty, and by his iuſtice ſhall giue vnto euery one according to his workes. This is the ſubiect of Fayth, and the reſt that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the Apoſtles Creed.</p>
               <p>By Hope, we haue our ſoueraigne truſt in him, &amp; expect of him, as of our firſt cauſe, and laſt end, help and ſuccour in the neceſſityes of this world, and eternall glory in the other.</p>
               <p>By Charity, we loue and ſerue him with all our hart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all thinges, according to his titles of Maieſty, adoring &amp; honouring him, with the inward acts of our ſoule, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by corporall workes agreeable to our fayth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions; alſo by firſt fruits, and tithes of our goods, but principally by ſacrifices, as the iuſt haue alwayes done before the comming of our Sauiour, by their ſacrifyces made of the bodyes of mortall creatures,<note place="margin">Maſſe the great ſacrifice of the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> and afterward Chriſtians by that of the Holy Maſſe, wherein is offered vnto God the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body of his only Sonne, in an vnbloody ſacrifyce, after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeth.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THE ſecond Commandement ſhall be the chiefe medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the morning of the fifth Day, contayning the prayer preparatiue, two preambles, and fiue pointes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue.</note>The firſt ſhall containe the accuſtomed demand, to wit, the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, by the which all our actions, and prayers may be made to the honour of God.</p>
               <p>The firſt preamble ſhalbe like that of the precedent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, differing in matter only, ſetting before the eyes of our ſoule the ſecond Commandement grauen in great letters in the firſt Table of the Law, <hi>THOV SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF GOD IN VAINE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond preamble ſhall aske grace to make particuler profit of this meditation. The firſt point ſhall obſerue that this Commandement informeth and teacheth the tongue, one of the moſt excellent members of man,<note place="margin">Our ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to prayſe God with.</note> to honour God, as the firſt inſtructed the hart: and as the tongue dependeth of the hart, ſo this commandement is a dependance or concluſion of the firſt; for if God muſt be honoured with a ſoueraigne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as the firſt teacheth; then it followeth that we muſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Name,<note place="margin">What is meant by the name of God.</note> which is the note of his Greatnes, as the name of a King is the note of Roialty; &amp; that we ſhould not take it in vaine, that is, without reuerence, &amp; iuſt cauſe: otherwiſe it is a diſhonour to him. This is therfore one conſequence of the firſt commandement, yet God would giue it a part, and in expreſſe termes, the better to particularize the markes of his honour, &amp; more diſtinctly to bridle tongues of worldly men, too much inclined to iniury his maieſty, with falſe and vaine oathes. It teacheth vs therefore to employ our wordes to the honour of God, and if we muſt ſweare, to ſweare holily, and not in vaine: now the name of God, as farre as we can know, is euery ſaying, or word, that ſignifieth the infinit Eſſence, wiſedome, bounty; as are, God, Lord, King of kinges, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16410:56"/> Lord of Hoſtes. Theſe names, and the like vſed in holy Scripture, are ſoueraignely honourable, becauſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to God, and God is honoured, and diſhonoured in them, as the King in his, by the vertue, or malice of men, and namely by their language.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſhall be employed to meditate,<note place="margin">Diuers wayes of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the name of God.</note> how we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the name of God m ny wayes, to wit, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him ſtoutly before all; when we profeſſe Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, authour of our ſaluation, God and man; when we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend holily to heare the word of God; when we ſinge his prayſes, when we pray to him, when we thanke him, as wel in aduerſity, as in proſperity, as holy men haue alwayes done, <hi>Dauid, Iob,</hi> and the like, who, were they in peace, were they in affliction, ſayd alwayes: <hi>The name of God be bleſſed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the the name of God is honou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red by ſwearing</note> But ſpecially, and according to the principall ſenſe of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, we honour his name, when we ſweare with piety, that is, when with neceſſity, truth, and reſpect, we call God to witneſſe of any thing, ſaying: God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, God knoweth, by God, I call God to witneſſe, as God help me, or any other wayes, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſweare; to which alſo are referred the oathes made by Saints, Angells, men, the Ghoſpell, by heauen, or earth, or other Creatures, all which appertaine to the prayſe of the Creatour, as they are vnder his rule and ſeruice.</p>
               <p>The third ſhall meditate the three conditions neceſſary to a good Oath, that is, Verity, Iudgement, and Iuſtice.<note place="margin">Three conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſwearing</note> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity commandeth, that what we ſweare be true, be it in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, denying, or promiſing, ſaying: ſo it is, or ſo it is not, or ſo I promiſe, and I call God to witneſſe: he that ſweareth without this condition, is forſworne, and doth a great iniury to the diuine Maieſty, calling him to be witneſſe of a lye, who is the firſt and ſoueraigne Verity. Iudgement teacheth vs to thinke well of that we ſweare, and not ſweare at aduenture, without neceſſity; and he that doth it, ſweareth in vaine, &amp; abuſeth the name of God. Iuſtice wills, that what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by oath be iuſt, and honeſt, otherwiſe it is one ſinne to ſweare it, and another to keep it; ſuch was the oath of the Iewes, binding themſelues not to eate or drinke, before they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16410:57"/> had killed S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 23.21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth ſhallbe to meditate, that as he offendeth God grieuouſly, who taketh his name in vaine, ſo doth he honour him greatly, who ſweareth with the foreſayd three conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by ſuch an oath he confeſſeth him firſt, to be the firſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which cannot lye, the ſupreme Maieſty, moſt worthy of reſpect and reuerence, and the ſoueraigne Iuſtice, hating all ſinne: So we read, that <hi>Abraham, Moyſes, Dauid, S. Paul,</hi> and other great ſeruants of God haue ſworne holily,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.23. 24.31. 2. <hi>Reg</hi> 19 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17.</note> and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to aſſure themſelues of ſome important truth; and God himſelfe did ſweare by himſelfe, to fortify his promiſe, that he made to bleſſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; to multiply his ſeed, as the Starres of heauen, and as the ſand of the Sea. Thereof it is that in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke iuſtice they cauſe men to hold vp their hand, or to put it vpon their breaſt, to the honour of God, the ſoueraigne Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and in fauour of innocency and right.</p>
               <p>The fifth ſhall meditate, how God is not content to giue this commandement, but alſo would add a threate to thoſe, that ſhould break it: <hi>God will not hold him innocent, who shall take the name of the Lord his God in vaine.</hi> This is to ſhew the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the ſinne, &amp; to put a bridle in the mouth of men, who doe eaſily fall into this fault, and to giue them to vnderſtand, that thereof doe come the greateſt part of tribulations and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, wherewith men are afflicted in their body, wiues, children, and goods. And therfore <hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi> ſayth: <hi>Thy mouth shall not be accustomed to ſwearing;</hi>

                  <hi>for there are many inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therein.</hi> And againe: <hi>The man that ſweareth much, shall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with iniquity,</hi>

                     <hi>Iac.</hi> 5.12</note> The prayer or ſpeach to God, ſhall be thus.</p>
               <p>My Lord, thou haſt giuen me a hart to belieue in thee, &amp; hope in thee, and to loue thee with all my capacity, and my tongue, as an interpreter of my hart, and an inſtrument accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and tuned thereunto, to exalt thy holy Name, &amp; with

               <p>THE Pilgrime hauing runne ouer the Commandments of the firſt Table, which concerne the loue and worſhip of God; he ſhall paſſe to thoſe of the ſecond Table, appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the loue and duty we owe to our neighbour, that is, to Angells and men.

As then the three precedent Precepts are conteyned vnder one alone which is the end of all, which biddeth, to loue God with all our hart for himſelf; ſo alſo the ſeauen following are conteyned vnder that which commandeth to loue our neighbour as our ſelues for the loue of God, to help and aſſiſt him with our goods, with our ability and induſtry, and to do him no wrong, and finally to loue him as our ſelfe. Alſo,<note place="margin">

The ſtraiteſt bond that is amongſt men, is betweene Father and ſonne, and therefore the father holdeth the firſt place in the liſt of neighbours: and for him is made the firſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, which ſhall make the meditation of the eight day, in this ſort.</p>

And this ſinne is in ſuch ſort againſt nature, that there is no creature, though neuer ſo cruell, that dareth kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and therefore the law doth puniſh with extraordinary ignominy ſuch furious folkes, after their death, as guilty of an extraordinary crime.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point ſhall marke, that by this commandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is alſo forbidden to hurt, ſtrike, or otherwiſe to endomage our Neighbour in body, though we kill him not; yea euen with our tongue to touch his good name by any iniury, or to beare any hatred to him in our hart, or deſire reuenge: and therefore our Sauiour, a ſage interpreter of his owne law, to ſhew what meeknes is required in his children to obſerue this law,<note place="margin">

O my Creatour and Redeemer, how rich art thou in mercy, and clemency! O my ſweet Ieſus powre it to me this ſpirit of thy ſweetneſſe, and graunt me for thyne own loue, that I may exactly keep what thou haſt commanded, that I may perfectly follow, what thou haſt taught by word and example, and that pardoning all, and profitting all, I may obtaine thy mercy, and at thy great day be partaker of thy glory with thy elect.

               <p>The preparation and preamble ſhall be as before: the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal conſiſt in theſe pointes following.</p>
               <p>The firſt point ſhall ponder that this precept prohibiteth not only adultery,<note place="margin">Al impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</note> which man or wife committeth, but alſo all kind of impurity, &amp; all that may cauſe it, as thoughtes, words, touchings, lookes, kiſſings, geſtures, diſhoneſt ſongs, vaine &amp; ſuperfluous attire, wanton talke, diſſolute beholding, paynting vnchaſt bookes, and ſuch like allurements to this vice. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is named as the principal head, &amp; the other acts as making way thereunto, and as complices to the crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How pleaſing to God purity of body is.</note>The 2. ſhall be employed to meditate how cleaneſſe and purity of body is in it ſelf pleaſing to God and his Angels: It is a vertue wholy heauenly &amp; diuine; for to liue in fleſh, and not to ſinne with the fleſh, is to liue in ſpirit, and to be like thoſe heauenly ſpirits who liue without ſtayne of fleſh. The Sonne of God made thereof ſo great account, that he would be borne of a virgin, he preached chaſtity, and by all meanes inuited me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereunto: he would haue about his Altars, miniſters, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried but perpetually chaſt; virgins alſo in his houſe as Queens betroathed to his maieſty by vow of virginity; barren in body but in ſoule fertill in all ſortes of vertuous workes: Finally he hath reſtrained the mariage of all thoſe, that liuing vnder the name of Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Chaſtity in euery vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> will be maried to one only wife, eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing a law of Chaſtity in all eſtates and degrees of his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould.</p>

               <p>The 3. point ſhall conſider, how contrariwiſe Impurity is as pleaſing to the Diuell our capitall enemy,<note place="margin">The ſin of the fleſh plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing vnto the Diuel &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> as it is diſpleaſing to God our Creatour. For though this wicked ſpirit hauing no body, cannot directly take any pleaſure therein, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it pleaſeth him wonderfully well, knowing that it diſpleaſeth God, and that aboue all other ſinnes, it maketh a man forget both heauen and hell: for there is none doth ſo darken the iudgement and vnderſtanding of man, and take away the taſt of heauenly things, &amp; the feare of hell fire, that doth more draw man from heauen, and from ſaluation, and that maketh him more carnall, more ſtupide and beaſtly.

               <p>The firſt point ſhall teach, that Theft is an vniuſt taking
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16410:67"/> or vſing another mans goods, either by fraud or force,<note place="margin">What Theft is.</note> or by any other vnlawfull meanes, and therefore heerein is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, not onely theft by cutting of purſes, or picking of our neighbours coffers, or in rouing by ſea, or robbing at land, but alſo in ill Merchants, and Magiſtrates, in buying &amp; ſelling in falſifying wares, meaſures, and workes, in ſelling iuſtice, &amp; ſacraments, &amp; other things which ſhould be giuen freely: In lending to vſury; in retayning what we finde without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of reſtoring, or enquiring for the owner; in keeping or buying that, which we know ſhould be rendred to the right owners, in aſſiſting and counſelling theeues &amp; robbers. And as there are diuers kindes of leachery, ſo are there of larceny;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Tho.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 99.</note> the one more grieuous then the other. Sacriledge, which is the vſurpation of things ſacred, is one of the greateſt. <hi>Peculatus,</hi> or ill adminiſtration &amp; iniuſt vſurpation of the publike treaſure to ones proper vſe, is very pernicious alſo, ſo that all iniuſt vſurpations are prohibited by this Law.</p>
               <p>The 2. point ſhall obſerue that the root of theft is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of hauing, the which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſignifieth when he ſayd;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>They that deſire to be rich, fall into temptations &amp; ſnares of the diuell, and into many hurtfull and vnprofitable deſires,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The root of theft is couetiſe.</note> 
                  <hi>which drowne men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: Thoſe that will be rich</hi> (ſaith he) who are led with the deſire of the goods of this world, are ſubiect to temptations, &amp; to many other miſchiefes.</p>
               <p>The tentation is firſt to caſt our eyes vpon the good of our neighbour; the vnprofitable deſire is the conſent we yield; the hand and execution, is the ruine &amp; perdition.</p>
               <p>The third ſhall conſider the euills that come of theſe ſinnes, and the remedies againſt them; for of picking &amp; ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling come enmities, diſſentions, clamours, murders, profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all holy things, and infinit other euills. The ſouerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne remedy to auoyde it, is not to ſet our mynd vpon earthly goods, but to be contented with mediocrity; and therefore Ieſus Chriſt author of this law, and the wiſeſt moderatour of men, teaching Chriſtian perfection, in that excellent ſermon vpon the mountaine, beginneth with the contempt of riches, with a maxime general and true, though a Paradoxe to the world, ſaying: <hi>Happy are the poore of ſpirit;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The prayer.</note>The ſpeach ſhall be thus: O my Lord thou haſt done thy part in making good lawes to bynd the handes and hartes of men, that no wrong ſhould be wrought to their goods, and that euery one, poſſeſſing his owne in peace, might liue in amity and friendſhip amongſt themſelues, with one hart and conſent might together render vnto thee praiſes for al thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits: But men haue not gouerned themſelues by thy lawes, but following the crookednes of their owne deſires, haue of brethren,<note place="margin">The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of couetiſe.</note> as thou didſt make them, made themſelues ſpoilers one of another, and are inraged one againſt another, worſe then rauening wolues, ſucking the bloud, life &amp; ſubſtance one of an other, by fraude, by force, by ſuites, by killing, and a thouſand other wayes; caſting their enuy where thy cannot reach their handes, and reaching their handes whither their deſires nor thoughtes ſhould not extend.

It is an example liuely to teach men their duty, who haue not onely not learned this leſſon to leaue their owne, but contrariwiſe they couet that of their neighbours, &amp; if they may, will iniuſtly inuade it.

               <p>In the firſt point the Pilgrime ſhal conſider, how theſe two Commandements do indirectly reſpect all the former, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the ſixth, which forbiddeth adultery, and the ſeauenth which prohibiteth theft, ſo that thoſe do bind the will, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and feet, that we neither conſent nor proceed to the outward execution of the ſinne;<note place="margin">

               <p>For the ſecond point, he ſhal note, that this prohibition of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16410:70"/> carnall deſire extendeth it ſelfe to that which may cauſe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as to eating &amp; drinking diſordinatly,<note place="margin">Il thogh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden and all that may cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>For the third point he ſhall conſider, that carnall thoughts not conſented vnto, but rather reſiſted, and reiected, are not only no ſinne, but alſo matter of merit, and therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout ſoule muſt not be diſmayd, when ſhe feeleth againſt her will thoſe thornes of her fleſh; as the Apoſtle when he ſayd: <hi>I know that in me</hi> (that is in my fleſh) <hi>there dwelleth no good:</hi>

                  <hi>I ſee another law in my members, fighting againſt the law of my mind, and making me captiue to the law of ſinne, which is in my members.</hi> The corruption of his fleſh made his members rebell, and made warre againſt him, but he reſiſted &amp; wonne the victory ouer his rebelles: he would gladly haue beene altogeather deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them; but they will beare vs company as long as we liue heere: Theſe are the thornes and thiſtles of our curſed earth, friends to our enemy, from which we cannot be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather exempt in this life. It is reſerued for the next,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17</note> where without all rebellion our ſoule ſhall rule and reigne in her body, in pure and plentifull peace: and therefore ſhe muſt not looſe courage, if ſhe be aſſailed, but rather reioyce that ſhe may with the grace of God ouercome all aſſaults, if not without any pricking, yet without any deadly or mortall wound, and of theſe briers, to erect monuments and trophies, of vertues and gaine a crowne of eternall glory by the victory.</p>

All theſe were hidden in the foreſayd Maximes, neither had there beene need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther law, had mans ſight remayned ſound and cleare, and that naturall light had not beene darkened in him.

               <p>IN the morning of this fifteenth day, the Pilgrime ſhall make his meditation vpon Good Workes, as order requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; for after the Commandements, Counſells, Grace, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the guifts of the Holy Ghoſt are giuen, and reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for working well, doth very fitly follow theſe medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that haue beene made of all them.

                  <note place="margin">All the Bible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth to good-works.</note>The firſt point ſhall be to meditate, how as well the old Teſtament as the new euery where exhorteth man to do wel, and to abſtaine from euill, ſhewing him that to that end God made him, placing him as ſoone as he was made in Paradiſe, to keep and labour it, with a law of obedience, not to touch the Tree of the knowledge of good and euill; and to the ſame end after his fall,<note place="margin">

               <p>In the new Teſtament, there is nothing oftener or more earneſtly recommended vnto vs then good workes. All the ſermons of our Sauiour are founded vpon this Theme, and in one of them he foretelleth, that at his great day, at the ſhuting vp of the world, he will iudge men for their good or bad workes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.42.</note> to eternall glory, or confuſion; and in one place he promiſeth reward euen vnto a cupp of cold water giuen for his ſake ſhewing that he will leaue nothing, though neuer ſo ſmall without recompence,<note place="margin">

               <p>The ſecond ſhall note, that good workes meaſured by the foot of bare nature, without any other quality, and as an effect only of free will, doe not merit eternall glory, a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted action hauing no proportion to a recompence of an infinit valew: but being conſidered not in it ſelfe, but as grafted in heauenly grace, and the infinite vigour of the holy Ghoſt dwelling in the ſoule, giuing it the right of adoption towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des God, by the merits of Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">The wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </note> By <hi>S.

Of which defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he ſhall learne, that there is nothing ſo foule, and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as ſinne. For what can be found more monſtruous, then that which is oppoſite to the law, &amp; rule of the higheſt wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, beauty, and goodnes?</p>
               <p>The ſecond point ſhall conſider two ſortes of ſinnes, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, and Actuall, and this mortall and veniall. Originall ſinne,<note place="margin">Aug. ench. <hi>164.</hi>

               <p>O my ſoule tremble with feare,<note place="margin">The Prayer.</note> at the remembrance of this fearefull day; for if <hi>Dauid, Iob,</hi> the Prophets, if the pillars of vertue haue ſhaked, how great ought thy feare to be, poore ſinnefull and feeble creature that thou art? With what ſenſe &amp; feeling ſhouldeſt thou meditate vpon the holding of this day, the Iudgement of iudgements, and the laſt of all? What wilt thou then doe? What Aduocate ſhalt thou haue? Who dareth defend thee from this iuſt Iudge, if he be offended with thee? How ſhalt thou heare the irreuocable ſentence, when it ſhall be pronounced? What ſhalt thou do, if he condemne thee? O ſweet Ieſus, keep me from thy wrath to come, if it pleaſe thee, and giue me now a penitent hart, that may deſerue both now and then, the voice of thy mercy. Let me in this baniſhment, ſuffer a thouſand deathes, but at that day let me liue with thee. Afflict me, whippe me, cut me, burne, my ſoule, my life, my fleſh, my bones, with al ſorts of tribulation, perſecution, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and torments, but may it pleaſe thee to pardon me then for euer, O Lord.

               <p>The firſt preamble ſhall repreſent S. <hi>Ioachim,</hi> and <hi>S.

               <p>The other cauſe of this oblation is more high, that is, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of God,<note place="margin">The 2. cauſe.</note> who had decreed before the creation of the world to make a paterne or principal worke in this B.

               <p>THIS morning the Pilgrime ſhal take, as following the former, the Eſpouſall of the B. Virgin with <hi>S. Ioſeph,</hi> which was done by diuine diſpenſation, for cauſes which we muſt conſider afterward, after ſhe had remayned in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vntill fifteen years of age, at which tyme the virgins were commonly wont to be placed in mariage according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe, and practiſe of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>The prayer preparatory ſhall be as accuſtomed.</p>

               <p>The ſecond preamble ſhall demand a ſpeciall light to know this myſtery.</p>
               <p>The firſt point ſhall be to conſider, how meruailous this mariage was,<note place="margin">The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous mariage of the B. Virgin.</note> and accompanied with prerogatiues extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of honour and grace, as well as her Conception, Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Infancy, and Preſentation, and all the degrees of the life of this moſt happy Virgin, as we haue ſayd in the former Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
               <p>The wonders and prerogatiues of this Mariage amongſt others were theſe. 1. That both parties were not only virgins, but purpoſed ſo to continue. Of the B. Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> none may doubt; for the Scripture doth euidently ſhew,<note place="margin">Maried with vow of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</note> that ſhe had made a vow of perpetuall chaſtity, &amp; the fayth of the Church is, that ſhe was alwayes a Virgin, before, in, &amp; after her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth.

                  <hi>S. Hierome</hi> diſputing againſt <hi>Heluidius</hi> that infamous he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiarch:<note place="margin">Aug. l. de S. Virg. Greg. Niſſ de Cr natiuit. <hi>Ioſeph a pertuall virgin</hi> adu. Helu. ad finem. Aug ſerm. <hi>15.</hi> de nat. Domini.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou houldeſt</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>without reaſon, that</hi> Mary <hi>did not continue a Virgin, but I hould with reaſon, not only the contrary, but that</hi> Ioſeph <hi>alſo was a virgin by</hi> Mary: and giueth the reaſon ſaying: <hi>To the end that the Sonne of God might be borne of a virginall mariage.</hi> S. Auguſtine, of the ſame ſpirit: <hi>Hould thou, O Ioſeph thy virginity, common with the Virgin thy ſpouſe; for that the power, and strength of the Angells shall be borne of her.

Da. ep. <hi>11.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi> ad Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col. Rom. Pontif.</note> hold the ſame. And <hi>Peter Damianus</hi> a noble writer of his age, ſayth boldly, That, this is the fayth of the Catholike Church. And ſurely if our Sauiour being to goe out of this world vnto his Father, thought it not meet to commit the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of his Mother a Virgin, though of good yeares, to the keeping &amp; truſt of any but of a Virgin,<note place="margin">Gerſ. ſer. <hi>5.</hi> de nat.

Iohn;</hi> is it not like, that being young, &amp; not his Mother, he would mary her to a man that was not a virgin, and that had not made a vow to perſeuere in that eſtate? we muſt thinke therfore that the B. Virgin was aſſured to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and he to her againe, with purpoſe of perpetuall continency, inſtructed therunto by the ſecret inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt, and ſtrengthned with a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fayth, that God would able them to liue both virgins, and married folkes togeather.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this mariage was meruailous in this point aboue other common marriages, that notwithſtanding the purpoſe of virginity in them both, yet was it a true mariage, and the Scripture doth plainely teach this truth;<note place="margin">Ambr. de inst. virg.

                  </note> for it calleth the B. Virgin, the ſpouſe and wife of <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> and this is the beliefe of the Doctours, and of the Church. <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> ſayth: <hi>The Bl. Virgin the mother of our Sauiour, being betrothed to her husband, was called his wife, euen as mariage is called mariage, when it is made by

                  </note> 
                  <hi>by reaſon of the firſt fayth of his aſſurance giuen to the B. Virgin, although he neuer knew her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, nor might doe; neither therefore was vaine, or falſe that name of husband, for this Virgin ought to be more holily and admirably pleaſing to her ſpouſe, who was to be fruitfull without the worke of man, vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in lignage, equall in fayth and fidelity.</hi> And a little before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the faythfull to this continency,<note place="margin">Wedding without bedding.</note> vpon the example of this marriage: <hi>By this example</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is ſignifyed to married Chriſtians, that mariage may be made and vowed by common conſent, with the mutuall affection of the hart and ſpirit only, without lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather.</hi> And indeed many haue liued in this ſort; <hi>Henry</hi> the 2.

               <p>Thirdly this marying is meruailous for the admirable vertues,<note place="margin">The loue &amp; fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this couple.</note> and namely for the coniugall fayth and charity of both parties, and by the excellency of lignage, and by all that may make a marriage complete: <hi>All the good of mariage was found heere,</hi> (ſayth S.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16410:109"/> ſeemeth that they needed not to marry at al:<note place="margin">S. Thom. <hi>3.</hi> p. q. <hi>28.</hi> art. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> but the more this mariage may ſeeme to be againſt reaſon, ſo much the more may it ſeeme diuine, and conſiderable. The Saints yeild diuers cauſes, whereof one concerneth the perſon of the Sonne of God, others concerne his Mother, &amp; ſome others, our Fayth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Seauen cauſes of this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note>The firſt is, that our Sauiour ſhould not be reiected of the Iewes, who not belieuing that a Virgin could beare a child, would ſurely haue iudged him illegitimate, and to haue byn borne of a diſhoneſt woman; wherof S. Ambroſe ſayth: <hi>Who could haue blamed the Iewes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Thom. <hi>3.</hi> p q <hi>29.</hi> art. <hi>10.</hi> Ambr. in Luc. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>or Herod, perſecuting Ieſus Chriſt, if he had beene thought to be illegitimate? And if they did perſecute him not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, hauing a good conceit of his natiuity, what would they haue done, if they had iudged him, to haue beene borne of adultery?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, that he might be knowne to be the Sonne of Dauid by the Genealogy of his line and iſſue, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes done by the line of the Father, as appeareth by S. <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> who deduced it; whereby <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be of the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> they could not doubt but that the B. Virgin was ſo alſo (ſhe being an heire who might not be maried out of their owne linage) and that the child borne of her was the Sonne of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third, that he might be helped not only by the care of his Mother, but alſo of her husband, for whome it was more meet to vndertake and menage ſuch a buſineſſe then for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And therefore when he was to execute any thing, the commandement was alwayes directed to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> as when there was queſtion of going to Aegypt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.48</note> or returning backe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like.</p>
               <p>The fourth, to the end that the Virgin ſhould not be infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or puniſhed as vnchaſt; ſo that our Sauiour choſe rather to be accounted the Sonne of a Carpenter, then of a diſhoneſt woman: whereof very fitly ſayth S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in Luc. 17. <hi>He choſe rather that ſome should doubt of his owne birth, then of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers chastity,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>and would not haue the fayth of his Natiuity ſounded vpon the iniury of another, that is, of his Mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth, that ſhe might be comforted by the aſſiſtance of Ioſeph, namely in her long iournyes and voyages, and dwelling many yeares in ſtrang countreys, as ſhe did.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:16410:109"/>
               <p>The ſixth, that the Church might haue a certaine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in S. Ioſeph, that Ieſus Chriſt was borne of a Virgin, for as none could better tell then he, that the Mother was a Virgin, <hi>ſo none could giue a more certaine testimony thereof,</hi> ſayth <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> 7. <hi>in Luc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeauenth and laſt was, in the perſon of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to honour the eſtate of virginity and mariage, and therin to figure and repreſent the condition of the Church, which being a virgin, is notwithſtanding marryed to Ieſus Chriſt, and remayning a virgin doth bring forth children by Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. The 3. firſt cauſes concerne the perſon of our Sauiour, the fourth, and fifth his Mother, and the other the Church, and altogeather the honour of God and his Mother, and our good and ſaluation. The Eſpouſals being done, the Virgin remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Nazareth, in her Fathers houſe,<note place="margin">Philo Iud. de ſpecial. legib.</note> which eſpouſalls were as faſt &amp; of as great force a the mariage it ſelf, ſo that if the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed ſhould commit any fault in the houſe of her Father, ſhe ſhould be ſtoned as an Adultereſſe, who had broken her fayth in her husbands owne houſe. In the ſame houſe the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin was ſaluted by the Angell, and there dwelt with Ioſeph after the death of <hi>Ioachim</hi> and <hi>Anne,</hi> and not in the houſe of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> (which by likelihood was at <hi>Bethleem</hi>) wherof the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture giueth no reaſon, but only that by ſilence it ſignifyeth, that theſe eſpouſals were of another quality then others were, and that ſhe was alwayes a virgin, as thoſe that remayne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the houſe of their Fathers, and go not to the houſe of their husband to celebrare the marriage, as other marryed folkes do, who muſt looſe their virginity. The Pilgrime ſhal marke all this, thereby to prayſe the diuine Maieſty, and to giue him thankes, ending in this ſpeach.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:16410:111"/> marking, that the mariage might haue beene ſuſpected, by this inequality of age in the parties. It is probable indeed, that he was of good years, mature, and ſtrong, and fit to exerciſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of prudence, but not old; neither needed the Paynters to vſe that fiction, ſeeing it is as eaſy to God to giue chaſtity to youth, as to age And if the anncient Patriarch Ioſeph,<note place="margin">

Heere therefore the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime ſhall take matter to meditate, of the ſanctity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this holy perſonage, and ſhall thereby learne, that his death was happy.

Some ſay he departed, when <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt</hi> began to preach. The opinion of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that he died about the 12. yeare of our Sauiour is more agreeable to holy Scripture, which neuer in her narration forgetting to name <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> as long as he liued, neuer me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioneth him,<note place="margin">

               <p>At midnight for the firſt point, ſetting before him the fall of our firſt father Adam, his eſtate and miſery, he ſhal meditate withall, the goodnes of Almighty God, who made ſo great ſhew of his mercy to this his poore creature, at that very tyme when he was offended; for then accurſing the Serpent, who by a woman had wrought all our miſery, and in counteruaile threatning him with a woman, and the ſeed of a woman who ſhould cruſh his head; he promiſed in the ſame wordes a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to mankind, who ſhould be borne of that woman: <hi>I will put</hi> (ſayth he to this Seducer) <hi>emnity betweene thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>

               <p>OVR Pilgrime hauing taken ſome reſt, ſhall go betimes to the holy Chappell, there to make his morning Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which ſhall be of the Annunciation of this myſtery which he commeth to meditate.<note place="margin">Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> In the beginning of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation he ſhall conceaue in his mind, as profound reuerence towardes God, as poſſibly he can, as one that is to ſpeake in his preſence of a chiefe worke of his, of a myſtery and Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage full of maieſty; he ſhall with equall humility demaund a ſufficient light to ſee it, and to profit by it. He ſhall not neere need to imagine a place where the hiſtory happened, as in his other meditations; for he ſhall meditate the myſtery in the ſame place, where it was both tould, and performed; yet he may ſet before his eyes our B. Lady praying at the now Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell corner of the Altar, when the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> brought her

               <p>The firſt point ſhall be taken of the beginning of the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which ſayth: <hi>In the ſixth moneth, the Angell Gabriel was ſent of God to Nazareth, a citty of Galily to a Virgin whoſe name was Mary, eſpouſed to a man called Ioſeph, of the houſe of Dauid.</hi> Behould an Embaſſage in euery point excellent and honourable. In the Maieſty of him that ſent it, who is God; of the meſſenger ſent, who was one of the principall Angells; of the perſon to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was ſent, who was the greateſt Lady that euer was in the ſight of God;<note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baſſage.</note> of the myſtery or meſſage it ſelfe that was brought, a myſtery of all myſteries, which is the marriage of the Sonne of God, made with the Nature of man, agreed on by the ſacred Senate of the glorious Trinity, for the comfort of men; of the end for which it was ſent, which was to informe the B. Virgin, to haue her conſent, and accompliſh, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the mariage. Heere now the deuout ſoule contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the maieſty of this Embaſſage in the foreſayd circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſhall ſet before his eyes, all the ranckes of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Court of all thoſe happy Angelicall ſpirits, reioycing there aboue in this miſſion, and the aſſembly of thoſe iuſt Soules that before this departed, who hauing heard this good newes in Limbo, were in an admirable expectation of the comming of their Redeemer. It is ſayd, that this meſſage was done the ſixth month. This at the firſt hearing ſeemeth to be referred to <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> who was ſix monthes elder then our Sauiour;<note place="margin">Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate in the 6. age.</note> but in a myſtical ſenſe, the mention of this number goeth further, and teacheth, that this Conception of the Sonne of God, is annou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and accompliſhed in the ſixth Age of the world, as <hi>Beda</hi> ſayth. Alſo,<note place="margin">Man cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the ſixth day which is Friday, on which day chriſt was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed.</note> that as God created Man in the ſixth day of this world, which is our Friday, and that at the ſixth houre of the day, which is our mid-day; ſo he deſcended into the earth the ſixth day, and at the ſixth houre of the day; for on ſuch a day, was this Embaſſage made, to wit, the fiue &amp; twenty of March which that yeare was Friday. And vpon the ſame day, and houre, he aſcended vp the Croſſe, as the Scripture doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſignify. Conueniences which doe eaſily declare that the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16410:115"/> benefit of our Redemption was no more by chance or aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then that of our Creation, but proiected of purpoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages before, euen from all Eternity: and this long proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth teſtify the ancient &amp; fatherly loue of God towards vs.<note place="margin">The Aue Maria thrice a day.</note> The Catholike Church in remembrance of this Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and Myſtery which it teacheth, ſaluteth the Virgin at high noone, with theſe wordes of the Angell, as alſo at mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and night, to giue thankes to God for ſo notable a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, in thoſe three tymes which we haue ſhewed before to be remarkeable by the deuotion of the Saints; and therein ſhe ſheweth that ſhe doth not looſe the memory of that immortall benefit.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point ſhall conſider the wordes following. <hi>When the Angell was entred to her, he ſaluted her thus: All haile full of grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.28.</note> 
                  <hi>our Lord is with thee, bleſſed be thou among women: But she hearing this, was troubled at his ſpeach, and thought what manner of ſalutation this might be. And the Angell ſayth to her: Feare not</hi> Mary, <hi>for thou hast found grace with God: behould thou shalt conceaue in thy wombe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of this ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> 
                  <hi>and shalt bring forth a Sonne, and shalt call his name IESVS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Sonne of the moſt High: And our Lord shall giue him the ſeat of</hi> Dauid <hi>his Father, and he shall reigne in the houſe of</hi> Iacob <hi>eternally, and of his Kingdome there shall be no end. And</hi> Mary <hi>ſayd to the Angell: How shall this be done, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I know not man? And the Angell anſwering, ſayd vnto her: The Holy Ghost shall come vpon thee, and the vertue of the Higheſt shall shadow thee, and therfore the</hi> Holy <hi>that shall be borne of thee, shall be called the Sonne of God. And behould</hi> Elizabeth <hi>thy kins-woman, she hath alſo conceiued a ſonne in her old age; and this is the ſixth month to her that is called barren, becauſe euery word shall not be impoſsible with God. And</hi> Mary <hi>ſayd: Behould the hand-mayde of our Lord, be it done vnto me, according to thy word. And the Angell departed from her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behould firſt a wonderfull ſaluation. The Angel pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the bleſſed Virgin full of grace, and fullnes cannot be but diuine: he ſayth, that God is with her, no doubt with a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſpeciall aſſiſtance, and therefore he calleth her Bleſſed among women: A ſalutation neuer heard or giuen to any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arure by a heauenly ſpirit. The moſt humble and wiſe Virgin
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16410:115"/> was troubled, ſeeing the Maieſty of this meſſenger, and much more hearing the prayſes he pronounced;<note place="margin">The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of the Virg.</note> and not preſuming to open her mouth to anſwere, ſhe thought vpon that ſhe heard. A ſpirit very differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from that of our worldly Dames, who inſteed of troubling themſelues at the prayſes which the world giueth them, euen without ground or deſert, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and tickle at the leaſt blaſt of glory that bloweth in their eare; they lift vp themſelues, and ſwell in their hart,<note place="margin">The light<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of worldly women.</note> and the more is ſayd to them in that kind, the wider haue they their hart and eares open to heare more of their prayſes. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſeeing the heauenly Mayd to bluſh, and reading as it were in her face and ſilence her aſtoniſhment, called her familiarly by her name; did aſſure her, and aduiſed her not to feare, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing cauſe rather to reioyce, hauing ſo good a place in grace, and fauour of God, by him cheriſhed, &amp; choſen to be Mother of a King without a match, of a Sonne who ſhould ſucceed in the throne of Dauid, who ſhould reigne for euer in the houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and of whoſe kingdome there ſhould be no end, &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Mother of the Sonne of God; &amp; pronounced her Great in that meaſure, that ſhe accounted her ſelfe little.</p>
               <p>But behould a queſtion and doubt worthy of ſuch a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. She had conſecrated to God, her ſoule and body,<note place="margin">The B.V. firſt vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> by the vow of Chaſtity, the firſt in this prayſe and magnanimity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the daughters of Iſraell. She was troubled at his firſt wordes, by reaſon of humility; but hearing him ſpeake of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing and bearing a ſonne, ſhe was troubled by reaſon of her virginity: ſhe highly eſteemed the grace promiſed, but ſhe was carefull alſo of her owne fayth promiſed, and of her integrity, which ſhe would not looſe for all the treaſure of the world. How many Virgins be there cleane contrary, who willingly abandone their body and ſoule, ſo they may get the loue of ſome earthly Lord? The Angell doth deliuer her alſo from this feare, and ſheweth her that this Generation ſhall not be like others, by the company, or ſeed of man, or by any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the body, but heauenly without hurt of her virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall integrity, by the worke of the Holy Ghoſt, by the power of the Higheſt, by the grace of the ſame Sonne that ſhall be borne, the Holy of God, &amp; the ſonne of God: Adding that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:16410:116"/> her couſin being now both old &amp; barren,<note place="margin">Why the Angell maketh mention of Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> had concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a Sonne, &amp; that it is as eaſy to God to make a Virgin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, as an old and barren woman. The B. Virgin vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that her vow of virginity ſhould be kept &amp; preſerued, agreed and gaue her conſent, &amp; belieued that God could doe what he ſayd; and ſhe that was called the Mother of the moſt Higheſt,<note place="margin">The Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the Angel and the Virgin, differing from that of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and Eue.</note> calleth her ſelfe his ſeruant. O happy conference &amp; dialogue, and much more fortunate then that of the ſeducing Angell, and the ſeduced Virgin, in the earthly Paradiſe, who harkening to a promiſe of Deity, if ſhe would eate of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, ſuffered her ſelfe to be deluded with vanity, and made the firſt breach and entrance to the fall and ruine of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>O Virgin happy by thy virginity! more hapyy by thy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility! yet moſt happy by thy liuely fayth! Thy virginity hath made the Sonne of God amorous of thee; thy humility hath made him deſcend into thy wombe; but thy fayth made thee conceaue rather of the ſpirit then of the body.<note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> O verily full of grace, full of God, and verily bleſſed aboue all women: bleſſed aboue all Virgins in purity, aboue all Wiues in fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, aboue all Saints in fayth, hope, and charity, choſen from heauen to be the Mother of the Higheſt. For if a Virgin may be with child, nothing can ſhe more fitly bring forth then the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE third point ſhall meditate, how ſo ſoone as the B. Virgin had pronounced the wordes of her conſent, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould the hand-mayde of my Lord,</hi>

And this ſoule vnited to the word of God, togeather with the body had alſo at the ſame inſtant the vſe of reaſon &amp; free will, was filled with al ſort of ſpirituall graces aboue all men &amp; Angels, and found it ſelfe ioyfull and happy in the viſion of God.

               <p>This Conception then was full of the meruailes of the bounty of God in ſo markeable ſignes of his loue, and of his almighty power in ioyning things ſo difficill, which the Prophet foretold as an effect neuer happened before:<note place="margin">

               </head>
               <p>THIS day the Pilgrime ſhall make his meditation of the voiage of the B. Virgin to the houſe of her Couſin <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of the virgin in her voiage.</note> whome ſhe went to viſit immediatly after ſhe was ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Angell.</p>
               <p>For the firſt point of the meditation, the Pilgrime ſhal take the firſt part of the hiſtory: <hi>In thoſe dayes Mary roſe, &amp; went quickly to the mountaines, vnto a towne of Iudea:</hi> he nameth not this towne, as he did <hi>Nazareth,</hi> becauſe it concerned not the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16410:119"/> myſtery of the viſitation, &amp; ſuch a writer puts nothing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous in his hiſtory: he declareth only the courage and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the B. Virgin to vndertake and performe this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage which principally he meant to report. Here the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout ſoule ſhall firſt caſt her eyes vpon this heauenly mayd, great with God Almighty walking the fieldes, not with the traine or company of an earthly Queene, in Coach, or Litter garniſhed with veluet or cloth of gold, with ſoft beds and cuſhions, but in the ſimplicity of a daughter of Sion, on foot, in company of her Spouſe <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> though aſſiſted with a great company of Angels, for the guard of him they caried and of her, and followed her foot by foot through all the places ſhe paſſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly ſhe ſhall conſider the humility of the B. Virgin practiſing by worke the vertue which ſhe profeſſed in word,<note place="margin">Her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in viſiting S. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> calling her ſelfe the ſeruant of our Lord: the greater goeth to the leſſe, the virgin to the wife, the daughter of <hi>Dauid</hi> to the daughter of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the mother of God to the mother of a man, the mother of our Lord to the mother of a ſeruant, which are ſo many proofes of an heauenly humility. It was alſo very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient that ſhe ſhould excell in this vertue, &amp; meete for the Mother of him, who deſcended from heauen to her wombe by humility, to beginne to walke in humility. The Daughters of this world do not ſo; for when they are by others exalted to any greatnes, they make themſelues alſo greater in their own hart, and do highly diſdayne their inferiours; and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſhion of women with child, is to become heauy, and to ſeeke reſt, and eaſe of body. This B. Virgin goeth another way, as ſhe is of another ranke; for being exalted aboue the higheſt, ſhe humbleth her ſelfe to the loweſt, waxeth light with her load, and inſteed of reſt vndertaketh a troubleſome iourney to the Mountaines of <hi>Iudea.</hi> O wayes honourable with the ſteppes of ſuch a Creature, carrying in her bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells the Creatour! O happy Hills that were troden with the heauenly feet of the Bleſſed Virgin, and Mother of the moſt high, neuer did you beare ſo precious a burden, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuer did you performe a more honourable ſeruice! O my ſoule, ſee and contemplate here, behould this fruitfull Virgin,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16410:120"/> this daughter of Sion, this Mother of God, to fly with ioy, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed by him whome her ſelfe doth carry: behould her ryſing as a faire morning, vpon the top of thoſe beautiful mountaines aſcending thoſe hilly places like the Sunne ryſing from vnder his Horizon: behould the beauty of her face and ſoule ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the moſt gliſtering ſtarres, the modeſty of her pace &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the fire of her charity, the greatnes of her diuine fortitude and courage.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of S. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note>The ſecond point ſhall be taken from the ſalutation of the Virgin, and the effect thereof. It is ſayd that the Virgin ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the houſe of <hi>Zachary,</hi> ſaluted <hi>S. Elizabeth: And it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, when Elizabeth heard the ſalutation of Mary, the Infant exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in her wombe: And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost, and cryed out with a great voice, and ſayd: Bleſsed art thou amongſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and bleſſed is the fruit of thy wombe: And how commeth this to me, that the Mother of my Lord should come vnto me? For behould, as the voice of thy ſalutation was made in my eares, the Infant in my wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be exulted with ioy: And bleſſed art thou which haſt belieued; becauſe thoſe thinges shall be performed which haue beene ſpoken to thee by our Lord.</hi> In theſe wordes he muſt marke the meruailous vertue and force of the ſalutation of the B. Virgin, hauing ſo happily ſtrucken the child and the Mother, that they were both ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed and filled with the Holy Ghoſt, &amp; enabled to effects exceeding the common courſe of nature. The child receaued ſenſe and vſe of reaſon beyond his age, and leaped at the voice of the Mother of our Lord, honouring the ſayd Lord by that his motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Elizabeth did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy of thinges paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come.</note>The Mother was made a Propheteſſe, knowing by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, what had paſſed, when ſhe knew things ſecret, to wit, that the B.

Wherupon the Pilgrime ſhall conſider how much the Sonne of God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his mother in making her ſo ſoone the inſtrument of the Holy Ghoſt, and his cooperatreſſe to ſo high effects, &amp; in what credit ſhe muſt needes be now in heauen for the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </head>
               <p>THE ſecond point ſhall be to conſider how the Sonne of God did heerin an act of an Almighty King, although
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16410:128"/> he appeared low and humble. The Kings of the earth when they are crowned, and take poſſeſſion of their kingdomes, are viſited by diuers Embaſſadours, and honoured by forren Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Here our Sauiour entring into poſſeſſion of his ſpirituall kingdome, is not only honoured by Embaſſadours, but ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Kings the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues comming vnto him in perſon.<note place="margin">Meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctions.</note> Of which worke the contemplatiue ſoule ſhall take occaſion to conſider, the meruailous conioyning of things moſt different, which our Sauiour made in all the parts of his life. And euen as he had maried into one perſon two naturs infinitly diſtant, the natures of God and man, to be a mediator, God and man, betwixt God &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo hath he alwayes ioyned diuine actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to humane, and teſtified the truth of theſe two natures, by the diuerſity and encounters of workes directly oppoſite. In his Incarnation, it was an act of great humility, &amp; abaſement that God was made man, yet was it a moſt high worke, that this man was borne without man, by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, of a Virgin. In his Natiuity, was ſeene the Son of God borne in a ſtable, hauing leſſe then the leaſt among men, but the ſame is ſong by the Angels, and adored aboue by the immortall ſpirits; he cometh weake out of the wombe of his Mother, yet mightily he preſerueth the virginity of his Mother; he is ſwadled in poore cloathes, but is enlightned with the ſplendour of heauen. In his Circumciſion, he was reckoned among ſinners,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.</note> but he took a Name aboue al names whereat euery knee ſhould bow in heauen, earth, and vnder the earth. In this apparition and viſitation of the Sages, he ſeemed obſcure, and a poore man among men, but he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the Starres, and adored by the Kinges. And ſo in all the reſt of his life, and eſpecially in his Death, wherin we may ſee a wonderfull weauing togeather in one webbe, of thinges contrary and oppoſite, which encounter in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy. The Sonne of God is nayled to a tree as feeble &amp; faulty, and yet as ſoueraigne he giueth letters of grace, and as an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, of a great thiefe &amp; malefactor, he maketh a great and holy Confeſſour; he endureth the torments of temporall death, and promiſeth the Paradiſe of eternall life; men blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him on earth, and the ſtarres do moane him in heauen.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16410:129"/> The Iewes more hard then ſtones, haue no compaſſion of his anguiſhes, but the Rockes rent, the Graues opened, the Sun darkened to mourne for his death. Of al theſe encounters the deuout ſoule ſhall learne the wiſedome and power of this. Lord, hauing giuen vs ſo goodly inſtructions, to teach vs to admire, loue, and ſerue him.</p>

The hiſtory is, that it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by an expreſſe law, that the woman who was brought to bed, ſhould be vncleane a weeke, if ſhe brought forth a ſonne, and two if a daughter, and ſhould remaine ſometyme in her houſe,<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 12. <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.</note> before ſhe came into the Temple, not touching any thing that was holy, to wit, fourty dayes for a ſonne, &amp; fourſcore for a daughter; which dayes being expired ſhe came to the Temple to offer her fruit, with a Lambe of one yeare old, or a Pigeon, or Turtle, which were ſacrificed, the Lambe as an holocauſt for thankes-giuing; the Pigeon, or Turtle for expiation of ſinne. If the Mother could not haue a Lambe, either for the tyme of the yeare, or by reaſon of her pouerty,<note place="margin">The males conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God.</note> ſhe offered two Pigeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or Turtles to the ſame effect. Moreouer the Male firſt-borne, by right of being the eldeſt was conſecrated to God, and pertained vnto him to ſerue in his houſe: but becauſe God had choſen all the Tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> for the ſeruice of his Altars, he permitted them of other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes to redeeme their firſt-borne, with fiue ſicles of ſiluere and ſo to be deliuered of that obligation. The B. Virgin then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the law came from Nazareth to Hieruſalem (where was the only and the famous Temple of the Iewes) the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith day after the birth of her eldeſt Sonne, with a payre of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons. This is the hiſtory, whereon the Pilgrime ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in his ſpirit, and contemplate this heauenly Virgin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming with the bleſſed fruit of her wombe, firſt to offer him to his Father, &amp; to exerciſe her humility, ſubmitting her ſelfe to the law of Purification, though neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had any need thereof; and that the ſoueraigne Sauiour. Prince of the law, was aboue the law, and the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin was exempted, for not hauing conceaued ſo as ſhe could become vncleane like other women, for whom this Law was made. And thus hauing made his midnight prayer, he may reſt vntill the morning.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt point ſhall be to conſider, that the principall cauſe of this ceremony, was to make man vnderſtand, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his impute and vncleane generation, by reaſon of that infernall ſtaine of originall ſinne, wherwith all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam,</hi> borne by the ordinary courſe are infected. This is the confeſſion which <hi>Dauid</hi> made, when bewailing in his owne perſon the miſery of all mortall men, he ſayd:<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, and make them call for help, whereby they might be cleanſed from this corruption, God did inſtitute certaine Ceremonies, which containe a leſſon of this learning and knowledge, as were the ceremonies and ſacrifices of the law of Nature, which did ſufficiently ſhew the beginning of man to haue beene infected,<note place="margin">Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the law of nature</note> and the great need he had of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God to be cleanſed. But aboue all was the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion commanded to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was done by cutting the moſt rebellious part of the body, the inſtrument of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, of generation, and corruption. In the law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> ceremonies were ſo much more multiplyed,<note place="margin">Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the law of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> as men were more deeply drowned in darknes, and the ignorance of their owne miſery, and had need of more light to diſcouer it. For there was not almoſt any man beſide the Iewes, that had any newes or notice of originall ſinne, nor of the remedy thereof.

                     </gap> ignorant of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſinne.</note> but they could not diſcouer the ground and roote of all thoſe errours, and diſorders wherein they ſaw mankind wander, which though being a reaſonable creature ſhould of all others haue beene beſt ruled and ordered.

                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 11.</note> held the firſt place; for it did plainly and publikely declare the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16410:131"/> corruption of our generation, and the neceſſity of the expiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof.</p>
               <p>The firſt point the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth make vs ſee on the one ſide, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the corruption of men, which beginneth at their firſt being, &amp; on the other ſide, the obedience of the Sonne of God and his Mother, obeying the law they were not bound vnto; their humility, placing themſelues among ſinners, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſacrifices for ſinne; although the one was cleaneſſe it ſelfe come for to cleanſe vs, and the other all pure and free, not only from actuall ſinne, but alſo by a ſingular prerogatiue preſerued from the touch of Originall, common to all men, as is ſayd before.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">God will be known in his guifts</note>The ſecond point ſhall meditate the ceremony of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and ſacrifices, &amp; ſhall ſhew him, how the Iuſtice of God requireth that with thankeſgiuing, we offer vnto him the good we haue receaued of him, and namely that Fathers and Mothers ſhould offer their children, which is the beſt fruit of mariage;<note place="margin">Good workes are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> &amp; that all Chriſtians ſhould offer their good actions, which are their ſpirituall children, ingendred and brought forth by the inſpiration and grace of God: and this was the morall ſenſe of this ceremony.</p>
               <p>In particuler the deuout Pilgrime ſhall marke, that this day was preſented to the ſoueraigne God,<note place="margin">The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ouer was preſented in the Temple.</note> the moſt noble and rich offering that euer was preſented in the compaſſe of the Sanctuary, and that by the handes of the greateſt Lady of the world. The offering was his owne deere ſonne, a ſacred and liuing oblation, infinit rich &amp; noble. She that preſented it was his glorious Mother, gloriouſly endowed, enriched and adorned with al the vertues that might exalt a creature aboue all other creatures, humane or Angelicall. <hi>Anna</hi> made an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable preſent,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 1.24.</note> when ſhe offered to the Temple her little child <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was to be a great ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, yet he was but a ſeruant, a creature, a vaſſall or ſubiect: Heere is offered the Maiſter, the Creatour, the King, the Sonne of the Father, God of God, Almighty of Almighty, not by an ordinary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin or Mother, but by a Virgin ſingular, and without exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in her degree, and a mother moſt ſingular, the mother of God.

               <p>THE third point ſhal meditate the Canticle of venerable old <hi>Simeon,</hi> a man iuſt and fearing God, who a few dayes before had reuelation from the Holy Ghoſt, that before his death he ſhould ſee the Annointed of our Lord, that is, the Sauiour of the world, IESVS Chriſt, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming then in ſpirit into the Temple, when the B. Virgin and S.

               <p>EARLY in the morning an houre before going abroad, <hi>Lazarus</hi> and <hi>Vincent</hi> entred into the meditation of theſe points a part by themſelues. <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſpake thus to God, and to his ſoule: My Lord and faithfull guide, direct (if it pleaſe thee) my affections and actions to thy honour, and glory, &amp; to the profit of thy poore ſeruant. I behold thy deare Sonne, made a litle Infant and feeble for me, to fly the perſecution of of <hi>Herod,</hi> vniuſt vſurper of the Scepter of the Hebrewes, thy children, and thy kingdome, and to be caried into <hi>Egypt</hi> in the armes of his diuine mother, as the Sunne in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I deſire to ſee the courſe of this myſtery, and to profit thereby (accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh my deſire, ſeeing thou haſt giuen it me) and to haue my vnderſtanding enlightned with the beames of thy grace, well to meditate, &amp; my Wil heated with the fire of thy loue, ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to imbrace vertue, and to walke conſtantly in the wayes of thy commandements. I conſider here (O my ſoule) the faythfull and ſweet Prouidence of this heauenly Father, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſing <hi>Ioſeph</hi> by his Angel to fly, and to withdraw his So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne from the cruelty of the Tyrant; for though he were ſent, and came to dye, yet not in that age, nor in that ſort, but in the flowre of his age, and by the death of the Croſſe would he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh our Redemption, and beſtow on vs in the meane tyme, the benefit and vſe of his life, to inſtruct vs by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:16410:138"/> of his heauenly vertues and wonderfull workes, &amp; by the doctrine of his holy preachings, to ſhew in his life and death, the ſignes of his infinite loue, with moſt manifeſt and cleere proofes. If he had beene put to death in his cradle, men had wanted all thoſe euident teſtimonies of his Charity, ſo many motiues to belieue in him, and to receaue him for the promiſed Meſſias. This little child then perſecuted ſo ſoone by the Princes of the world, viſible and inuiſible, taketh his way to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and as weake giueth place to the Tyranny, which he could as well haue repreſſed by reſiſtance, as auoid by fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But he would doe, what himſelfe had before taught his ſeruants, and would by his example, ſhew his diſciples what they ſhould do in like caſe.

He aroſe in the night, tooke the child with diligence, tooke the Mother, and went towardes <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by the ſame deſart whereby the Hebrewes paſſed to <hi>Iudaea.</hi> This tender Virgin bare her little child in her boſome, and cloſed in her armes whome the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the heauens could not comprehend; ſhe feareth his danger, and relyeth in his prouidence, willingly endureth the horrour of the deſart, and the weariſomnes of the way, and gathereth of her paines, the ioyes of iuſt ſoules, in the loue of him, who came into the deſart of the world to ſuffer. O how gracious a ſpectacle to heauen is this little company! O deſart more happy in theſe three Hebrew Pilgrimes, then in that infinite multitude that paſſed before. A deſart ſanctifyed by theſe heauenly trauaillers, ſigned and conſecrated one day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be the repaire of ſanctity, the earthly Paradiſe of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>THVS prayed <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the morning according to the light God had imparted to him, <hi>Vincent</hi> for his part, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made the ſame meditation, and recommending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the protection of the B. Virgin, and their good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, they began their iourney, ſaying their <hi>Itinerarum,</hi> and their other accuſtomed prayers. And they walked thus ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vntill about noone, ouer the wild plaines, and barren, but only of briers, and broomes, wherof they ſaw good ſtore in the bare Champion, without meeting either man or beaſt; and they felt themſelues now well wearyed &amp; tyred, as wel for hauing eaten little that morning, as for the exceſſiue heat of the Sunne. At laſt looking heere and there about them, &amp; ſearching ſome place to refreſh themſelues in, they ſpyed on their right hand certaine willowes, behind a little hille, and hoping there to find ſome water, they went ſtraight thither, and they found in the mideſt of theſe thicke, &amp; ſhadowy trees a fountaine cleere as Chryſtall, which bubling out plentifully made a litle brooke full of creſſits, which was a ſigne that the water was good. It was ſome what deep, the bankes being high, and couered partly with moſſe, and partly with herbes
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:16410:141"/> and floures of that ſeaſon, for it was the moneth of May. Then ſayd <hi>Vincent,</hi> Our way agreeth not ill with the matter of our meditation; for this morning we paſſed in ſpirit, through the deſart of <hi>Arabia,</hi> deſiring to ſuffer ſomewhat to the imitation of litle Ieſus, and his good Mother, who ſuffered there diuers incommodities, we haue alſo paſſed this with ſome paine. It is true, replied <hi>Lazarus,</hi> we haue ſuffered but little, and good Ieſus and his Mother had quickly compaſſion of vs, hauing at a pinch prouided vs of a reſting place,<note place="margin">The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes dinner.</note> ſo fit for our dinner and refreſhing: and ſo they ſtucke their ſtaues in the ground, and ſet them downe to take their repaſt. They had in their ſackes two or three manchets, &amp; a peece of cheeſe, with a few aples, and a little wine in their botles, and as they ſett forth their prouiſion vpon their greene napery, they perceaued a farre off one wandering, hither and thither, ſeeking as they throught either his way, or ſome fountaine; they had compaſſion of him and thought it a worke of charity to ſet him in his way, or to make him partaker of their good fortune, therefore they hung their dinner vpon the bough of the neereſt willow, leaſt ſome wormes, or venemous beaſt might touch it vpon the ground, and ranne ſpeedily where they had eſpied him. But they were amazed ſo ſoone to haue loſt the ſight of the man, and could not conceiue that he ſhould ſo quickly be walked out of their view, in ſo large and open a champion; and they did not perceiue, that as ſoone as he ſaw them, taking them for theeues, he hid himſelfe in a ditch behinde a little buſh, through which he ſaw them not being ſeene, and beheld them running from one part to another, being ſore afraid to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and ſpoild of that little ſiluer he had, which he caried to buy ſtuffe for his ſhop, for he was a merchant. So they returned ſoftly vnto their fountaine againe, perſuading themſelues that this fellow made ſuch haſt, thinking they were theeues, or els that it was ſome ſpirit, which they iudged more likly, becauſe he vaniſhed ſodenly. Being returned to the willowes, they go for their dinner, and behold they found a ſwarme of bees lighted vpon one of their loaues, and had all couered it with their hony dew. Oh (ſaith <hi>Vincent</hi>) our Lord would ſweete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our bread and our trauell: we muſt hope ſo (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>)

But holding their bread in their hands they perceiued in the bodies of diuerſe trees, certaine hides, out of one of the which this ſwarme came; they went to viſit it, &amp; tooke out two or three combes of hony for their dinner; when they had ſaid grace and began to fall to their meat, theſe little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures came flying and buzzing about them; ſome lighted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their bread, ſome vpon the graſſe, kiſſing and pinching with their little mouth the flowres wherewith the beauty of the fountaine was diapred, and ſucked out the liquour to make their hony: diuers drunke of the riuer, ſtryking at the little greene froggs, who lay like ſpies to entrappe them:<note place="margin">Frogges <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Virgin, and very charitable to Pilgrimes. This good man was at that time in a chamber ouer his gate, which looked towards the way, as ſoone as he diſcouered theſe to be Pilgrimes by their ſtaues, he came preſently himſelfe to meet them, and prayed them very hartily, like another good old <hi>Abraham,</hi>

The Pilgrimes ſtood meruailing at this honeſt and harty ſummon, &amp; coniecturing that they ſhould be happy in the company of ſuch an hoſt, they ſuffered themſelues to be perſuaded, and went with him. Entring into his houſe, they perceaued in the countenance of all the domeſticalls, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ioy that they had of their comming. The hoſt made them a ſigne to prepare ſome fruits, and taking the Pilgrimes by the hand: I know (ſaith he) that you would ſalute litle Ieſus and his Mother, and brought them to a little Chappell looking towardes the Eaſt, built at the end of a baſſe-court, with an Aultar in it to ſay Maſſe very well adorned, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers pictures of deuotion hanging vpon the walles. After they had prayed a while, <hi>Lazarus</hi> and <hi>Vincent</hi> ſet themſelues to behold the Tables, and deſired to vnderſtand them; but their hoſt told them, they muſt firſt drinke a draught of wine to refreſh their wearynes, and brought them to a hall hard by, where euery one beſtirred himſelfe to ſet ſomewhat on the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16410:145"/> table; one bread, another curdes, another freſh cheeſe, and other raw Artichokes, &amp; like fruite of the ſeaſon. They dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke once, and eat a few cheries. The hoſt ſeeing they would eate nothing els, I ſee well (quoth he) that you haue need of reſt, and would haue brought them to a chamber to repoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whilſt ſupper was making ready. The repoſe (ſayth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) ſhal be it it pleaſe you to ſee your pictures. Wel, quoth the moſt, but with that condition, that we may ſit; and ſo they returned to the Chappell.<note place="margin">Diuers Pictures.</note> They ſate downe all three, hauing before them the pictures. In the firſt, ſet vpon the Altar on good dayes, was the houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> carried by the Angells from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Sclauonia:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The houſe of Loreto</note> the picture was very pleaſant, and the inuention good, the colours liuely, and the lines cleane &amp;c. And the parts of the pictures compoſed with a proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very well meaſured, the Angells were hanging in the ayre in ſo many diuerſities of placings, of wings, armes, legs, and all the parts of the body, as there were perſons, with their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes ſo artificiall, that they raiſed, and repreſented ſo liuely their members and actions, as they ſeemed to be Images emboſſed, and to moue vpon the table. But aboue the reſt was pleaſant to behold the little Ieſus, and his holy Mother, who held him faſt in her hart-hand, that is, in the left, &amp; imbraced him with the right.

They were in great danger, as appeared by the picture, for the painter had ſet round about this ſhippe certaine loiſtes of Pirats, who going about her this way, and that way, as it were groping and at aduenture, purſued this ſhippe at euery turne from ſterne &amp; ſoredecke, from prow to poope, chaſed &amp; amazed like houndes, hauing loſt the ſight &amp; ſent of the beaſt. But the neerer they laboured to approach, the further they were off.

               <p>Concerning the hiſtory of the other Table, I thinke it is that good Florentine <hi>Dominico de Caſtro,</hi>

                  </note> who had his houſe ioyning to the riuer of <hi>Elſa,</hi> and was ſurpriſed in the night, by the inundation of the ſayd riuer, and was carryed downe the ſtreame, almoſt two miles, with his ſayd houſe flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him, and three of his companions alſo, and in the end were deliuered by the interceſſion of the ſayd Virgin; &amp; ſo we haue heard it told. The tale is very true, ſayth their Hoſt, as I haue alwayes vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lazarus</hi> would faine haue learned the hiſtory of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Tables,<note place="margin">Their ſupper.</note> the Pictures whereof he admired without knowing the ſtory, but their Hoſt fearing to make them ſtay too long: Let vs leaue, ſayth he, ſomewhat for afterward, in my opinion we were beſt now go to ſupper, the hiſtory may be told in Supper tyme, or after; ſo they returned to the Hall, where they found the Table couered with victualls. They waſhed their handes, ſayd Grace, and ſat them downe, euery one did his attendance, and the good old man was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes calling vpon his gueſts to be of good cheere, with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular demonſtration of harty good will; eſpecially when he
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16410:146"/> vnderſtood they were French men, towardes whome he alwayes bare a particuler affection, and in ſigne of the greater friendſhip ſpake French with them. Whilſt they ſupped di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers diſcourſes were propoſed of matters, pious and pleaſant both, ſuch as talke at the Table ſhould be. They talked of the Pilgrimages of the old Fathers in the law of nature, &amp; of Chriſtians now, of the piety of the ancient French men in that behalfe, of the miſery and troubles of this preſent age, &amp; of the prouidence of God therein towards his Church, what theſe Pilgrimes endured in their iournyes, and namely in the holy Land, by reaſon of theeues and robbers. And vpon this occaſion their Hoſt told them good tydings of their way, as long as they ſhould trauaile in thoſe parts, that a notable good Captaine with a certaine number of Horſ-men did ſcoure the fields and the woods, by the Princes commandement, to chaſe away the robbers who infeſted the wayes, &amp; had lately made an incurſion, and lead away certaine Pilgrimes priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners fiue or ſix dayes ſince. At theſe wordes <hi>Lazarus</hi> fetched a deep ſigh, for they went to his hart, doubting leaſt <hi>Theodoſius</hi> might fall into ſome miſchance, and be perhaps one of thoſe priſoners; for it was iuſt about that very time, that they loſt him. The good old man marked how he became penſiue, &amp; thinking it was vpon apprehenſion of theſe theeues and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſayd vnto him: Feare you not, for the wayes are now cleare, and ſafer then they were any tyme theſe two yeares, and will be ſafer euery day, when theſe gallants, and good fellowes ſhal be catched, as no doubt but they wil be ſhortly. I hope (anſwered <hi>Lazarus</hi>) that though there ſhould be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But I cannot chooſe to grieue at the abſence of one of our Countreymen, a vertuous yong man, and faithfull companion of our pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, who ſix dayes ſince ſtrayed from vs, and we know not whether he be dead or aliue; and I feare much that he is fallen into the handes of ſome theeues, or which were more lamentable deuoured of ſome ſauage beaſt; &amp; the very point of my griefe is this, that I can neither help him, not heare
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16410:147"/> any newes of him, ſince we firſt loſt the ſight of him, although we haue vſed all poſſible diligence; and we can now do no more, nor leſſe, then to ſigh &amp; pray to God for him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he be, and to hope in the prouidence of God, and in the help of this glorious Lady, to whome he was ſingularly deuoted: Behold the cauſe of my griefe, and my reſolution. Your griefe (ſaith their Hoſt) commeth of a ſingular loue &amp; friendſhip, and your reſolution is Chriſtian. If I haue any experience of the particular aſſiſtance of God towards them, that ſerue him, with a true and loyall hart, and honour the Mother of his deare Sonne, I dare aſſure you, that you ſhall ſhortly ſee him ſafe and ſound, and therefore be merry and make good cheere of this little we haue, and to which you are moſt hartily wellcome. <hi>Lazarus</hi> thanked him much, and found himſelfe much comforted in this good old mans talke, taking it as a Propheſy, and ſhewed from thenceforth a more cheerefull countenance. When grace was ſayd, he called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly for the narration of the miracles, attending to heare them for a ſweet recreation after their ſupper. I remember (ſaith their hoſt) I haue promiſed you to tel you two memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hiſtories, though I ſee you haue more need of reſt then of talke; but I will not refuſe what you requeſt ſo courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: heare then the firſt.</p>

They had not gone farre, but their maiſter perceauing they had ſtayed longer, then they were wont, repayred to the port to heare newes of them, where at the ſame time, he found the maiſter of the barke, and both of them were informed, that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16410:147"/> three men had a little before taken the barke, as to go on fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing. Immediately they made out after them two Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, furniſhed with men &amp; weapons, who followed them ſo luſtily with ſailes and oares, that they diſcouered them three or fowre miles of; <hi>Michael</hi> and his mates diſcouered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, and ſaw them follow after them in all fury, comming within the very ſight of their barke: there appeared no way to eſcape the handes of theſe Barbarians, nor the cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they were to endure, if they were taken. In the very point of the danger, they had recourſe to the mother of him, who commandeth windes and waues, and they make a vow of Pilgrime go to our Lady of <hi>Loreto,</hi> euen when the Turkes were ready crying, to lay their hands vpon their barke. They had no ſooner pronounced their vow, but ſtreight behold a ſodaine &amp; furious tempeſt aroſe, which ſcattered the veſſels, and ſeparared them one farre from another, and ſo diſordered the Purſuers, that they were forced to ſeeke rather ſome ſhore to ſaue themſelues, then to take the ſhip they followed. Theſe three that had thus fled, did ſee the other terribly toſſed by the waues, caried ſometimes hither and ſometimes thither, ſometimes aloft, ſometimes below, whome they knew by their turbants, which made them be ſeene a farre of. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the meane time held on their courſe, as in the calme Sea, driuen with a fauourable wynd, blowing in the poope, which did comfort them with a ſweet admiration, ſeing in ſuch contrariety of wether, of tempeſt, and of calme in the ſame time, &amp; almoſt in the ſame place, that it was the ſtroke, not of the Sea, but of heauen, &amp; an euident teſtimony of the fauour of God towards them. They ſailed happily vntil they arriued at the port of <hi>Catara,</hi> &amp; from thence went to <hi>Loreto,</hi> where cleanſed from their ſinnes by the Sacrament of Pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and made partakers of the Table of our Sauiour, they rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red immortal thankes to God, and the B.

I confeſſe O my ſoule, that in my morning me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, I did not preſent my ſelfe before thy diuine Maieſty with that reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I ought, nor made my prayer with due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and that by my only fault; for I did not well prepare my ſelfe according to the rules of deuotion, as neither to my examen in the morning, and after dinner. I haue wandered in my ſenſes and thoughts, my phantaſy hath often carryed me out of my ſelfe. I haue twice or thrice looſed the reines to my proper will, with ſome vaine delight &amp; complacence, and to fooliſh impreſſions in my imagination, &amp; opened my eyes to a careleſſe and curious beholding of thy creatures, my eares to curioſity, and my tongue to many idle words. I confeſſe theſe ſinnes, and belieue I haue committed many more which I know not: and who is he that knoweth his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16410:149"/> ſinnes? I confeſſe them all, O Father of mercy, &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly demand pardon of them, with a firme purpoſe to amend them, by the aſſiſtance of thy holy ſpirit. Giue it, if it pleaſe thee O Lord, to me, and to all of this houſe, and graunt that we may paſſe this night without offending thee, &amp; without illuſion of him, who day and night lyeth in watch to defile our body and ſpirit, and whileſt our body ſleepeth taking its reſt,<note place="margin">

About midnight <hi>Lazarus</hi> had a dreame which frighted him; for hee ſeemed to ſee <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his companion preſent himſelfe before him,<note place="margin">Lazarus his drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</note> all disfigured with a face pale &amp; blacke, deſiring him to call for the ayde and help of the B.

                  <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſayd not one word more vnto him, but prayed God in his hart in this ſort. O my ſweet Ieſus,<note place="margin">Lazarus his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> I haue been depriued of the company of my little Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who I hope is now with thee: thou gaueſt me him as a faythfull companion of my Pilgrimage, him, whoſe image was preſented vnto me this night; thou knoweſt if he be in that diſtreſſe my dreame told me, help him according to thy fauourable prouidence, wherwith thou aſſiſteſt thy children and ſeruants. Content thy ſelfe if it pleaſe thee, with taking one, and forbeare this other for a while; aboue all keep him from offending thee, or committing any thing againſt thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Law, &amp; conſerue in him the will which thou didſt giue him, to ſerue thee alwayes, with an entire and perfect hart;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16410:149"/> and if that which was repreſented to myne imagination were only a dreame, and not a preſage of ſome misfortune, and if my companion be not in that danger I feare, I know not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that in what eſtate ſoeuer he ſtandeth, he taketh care of me, as I doe of him; do vs the fauour once againe to ſee ech other.

Heere is preſented to the eyes of my vnderſtanding, thy deare and only Sonne, that walked with his Mother, a litle Pilgrime towards thy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where he was honoured with thee, but was hidden in the cloud of his humanity, and was not ſeene but to thoſe to whome thou hadſt giuen the eyes of fayth.

               <p>When they had both ended their meditation, the good

If there be any thing good in my houſe (quoth their hoſt) it is my good will, and your well-come, for the reſt I am farre ſhort of all others. But my Maiſters there is good newes, which wil make you glad; a certaine Church man a friend of myne a man of honour, came hither late yeſter night,<note place="margin">Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the Country-houſe.</note> who ſhall ſay you Maſſe this morning, and ſhall beare you company for theſe two or three dayes, for ſo long at leaſt you muſt needs be my gueſts, by the law of good Pilgrimes.

Syr, ſayth the good Hoſt, will you not beſtow a couple of dayes on your friends? Ten and more (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) to do them good, but I know it is not for your ſelfe, but for our ſelues, that you would ſtay vs. Perhaps (ſayth their Hoſt) God may change your mind at the Altar; and ſo not preſſing them any further, he brought them to the Chappell, where all the family was come togeather to heare Maſſe, which was to beginne. They heard it with an admirable contentment, and when it was done, they kiſſed the handes of the Prieſt, and ſaluted him humbly, who would willingly haue had ſome talke with them, but that he ſaw them ready to depart, and iudged it ſhould be in vaine to importune them; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were conſtrained to take their breakfaſt, in which tyme the hoſt forgot not to renew his requeſt, and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:16410:152"/> to intreat them a freſh to ſtay, with all the Rethorike his hart could furniſh him with, but he could not perſuade them. So he cauſed to put in their ſackes, ſome bread and apples, and for either of them a crowne of gold, without ſaying any thing, ſo they tooke their leaue with a thouſand thankes. The tears ſtood in the good old mans eyes, and he ſeemed as if they had beene his children, ſo great ſhew of loue did he make vnto them, &amp; did bring them ſome good peece of their way, with the good Prieſt and ſome others of the houſe. When he could go no further on foot by reaſon of his age, he imbraced them the ſecond tyme, and gaue them the direction for their beſt way, and thus was their departure this morning about ſeauen of the clocke.</p>
               <p>So, they ſayd their Pilgrimes prayers as they were wont to do, at the beginning of their iourney, they thanked the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence of his benefits, and namely of their good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter at this lodging: Then they fell on prayſing the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull charity of their good old Hoſt, praying God plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to recompence his liberality. At the laſt <hi>Vincent,</hi> who longed to know the dreame that waked <hi>Lazarus</hi> that night, deſired him to tell it. <hi>Lazarus</hi> told him all in few wordes, whereby <hi>Vincent</hi> tooke good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture of the aſſiſtance of God; for ſeeing God hath reuealed vnto you that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> is in danger, it is a ſigne that he is not dead, &amp; that he would help him by your prayers.

Both theſe diſcourſes gaue <hi>Lazarus</hi> &amp; <hi>Vincent</hi> cauſe of ſuſpition. For the two firſt put him in feare that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was drowned, hauing taken the way where he muſt needes paſſe that brooke, inſteed of the right: the two others put them in doubt of theeues, but that which aſtoniſhed them moſt, was that they ſaw, as they thought, vpon one of the Pilgrimes, the hat and habit of <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> and as they doubted &amp; would haue asked the Pilgrime, himſelfe ſayd in diſcourſing, &amp; not thinking of them, that he had bought his hat, and habit at <hi>Millet</hi> a village hard by. This ſtroke them to the hart, and made them almoſt wholy to belieue, that either he was drowned or killed, and his apparrell taken and fold, either by the Peaſants, or by the robbers, and they had but ſmall hope left of his good fortune.

If God permit vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pilgrimes of <hi>Loreto</hi> to dye as theeues, we ſhall receaue the crowne of our innocency, and of the ignominy which we
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:16410:155"/> endure for Gods ſake. But as you are ſent to puniſh theeues, and defend the innocent, ſo thinke it to be your duty, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your ſelfe wel of the truth, that you may know the one from the other; we demand neither life nor mercy, if we be found faulty, we requeſt onely that you would giue vs time and leaſure to certify you of our innocency, and our requeſt is not vnreaſonable; for as you haue ſome coniectures to doubt of our honeſty, ſo haue you no certayne proofe of any crime: Our habit at leaſt ſhould make you ſuſpend the execution of your iudgement. For why ſhould we be thus diſguiſed? what ſhould wee ſeeke for in the wood with our Pilgrimes wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons? Do theeues carry Pilgrimes ſlaues to performe their robberies? This merchant who calleth vs robbers, ſaying we would haue ſpoiled him, hath no cauſe ſo to ſay. The truth is, that ſeeing him yeſterday wander in the wilde fieldes, thinking he had loſt his way, we approched to him to direct him, &amp; to make him partaker of our dinner, if he would haue taried, but he vaniſhed I know not how. And he that depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth againſt our companion, may not cauſe him to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for his depoſition doth not accuſe him of being a theefe, but of being in their company, whereof I ſuppoſe he gaue you good reaſon, when you did examyne him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared why he was otherwiſe attired then we. As he ſpake in this ſort, ſtept forth one of the company, ſaying: My Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, theeues are alwayes innocent if you will heare them talke. They were found amongſt theeues with weapons in their handes, and taken as I may ſay in the manner, who can doubt what they are? If you heare my aduiſe, let them paſſe the pikes, and then this matter is diſpatched. The Captaine was perplexed, not well knowing what to do; for <hi>Lazarus</hi> tale had touched him, &amp; without hearing him ſpeake, he ſaw in their countenances, markes rather of good ſoules then of robbers, and determined in himſelfe to delay the matter as long as he could. At the ſame inſtant came two other ſaying: Syr why doubt we of the guiltines of theſe good fellowes, behold heere a man, whome they haue murdered, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him ſix paces off, they ſhewed him a man lying al along dead, and a dogge by him. This was the body that <hi>Lazarus</hi>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:16410:155"/> and <hi>Vincent</hi> had ſeene a little before. They were all three brought thither, where lifting vp their handes to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they proteſted that they were innocent of this crime, and ſayd no more. The Captaine found himſelfe more troubled then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In the meane time behold there came a troope of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, bringing two of thoſe robbers whome they had ſought after; whereof he was very glad, not onely for that they were taken, but that he hoped by them, to haue ſome certaine intelligence of the fact of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> He examined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a part, if they knew ſuch a man, whome he made be brought before them; they ſayd they knew him, and told all the ſtory of his taking, and of the changing of his apparell, iuſt as <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> had told it before, which did greately iuſtify &amp; diſcharge him.

Now all their occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was to go hunt, not beaſtes, but men, alwayes bringing in ſome new priſoners. They reſted neither night nor day; as well their body as their mynd was in a continuall diſquietnes, and me thought I was in hell amongſt Diuels, being among ſuch a company of theeues, ſauing for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort I had to ſuffer ſome thing for Ieſus Chriſt, who endured death for me, betwixt theeues; and to conſider on the one ſide the grace God had done me in giuing me the feare &amp; loue of his lawes, and on the other ſide the miſery of thoſe poore rogues, who ſuffered ſo much euill, at the laſt to endure the heape of all euils. Alas (ſaid I within my ſelfe) if thou didſt endure but as much for heauen, as theſe do for hell, if thou wert as conſtant to employ thy ſelfe in good works, to paſſe whole nights in prayer to ſaue thy ſelfe and others, as theſe do whole dayes in workes of iniquity, and vndertake a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand paines in diſcomodities of body and ſoule, to deſtroy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men &amp; themſelues! O Lord of the whole world I render thee immortall thankes for all benefits beſtowed on me of thy infinite bounty, and beſeech thee by the ſame bounty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my hart, and to make it more capable of thy heauenly loue, &amp; to increaſe the ſtrength of my ſoule, that I may ſuffer more, and with a better courage, for the glory of thy name. Open the eyes of theſe poore blynd ſoules, giuing them to ſee the indignity of their condition, and the miſerable eſtat of their ſoule, or els take from them all meanes to do any more harme. In theſe and the like diſcourſes did I paſſe day and night, and learned to make purpoſe of liuing better, of the diſdaine I conceaued in the ill life of this people; as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

Then I promiſed him on faith of a Chriſtian Pilgrime, that I would keepe his ſecret: he ſaid, this is the matter. They heere haue reſolued either to make you follow our manner of life, or els to kill you, for ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome they looke for none of you. All that haue come to ſee you, haue beene ſo many ſpies to ſound you, and ſee if there were any hope to perſuade you, wherein they make diuerſe and different reportes to our Captaine, and therefore looke to your ſelfe: thus much I know, becauſe I was at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and deliberation, when it was taken. When I heard this ſectet, I doubted whether himſelfe alſo came to ſound me, and to feele my reſolution, neither was I deceaued, though he did it with a good intention and meaning, and therefore I anſwered him roundly, that I was ready rather to dye, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make ſhipwracke of my conſcience, yea, or of my reputation and honour, in imbracing a vocation proper not for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but for <hi>Tartars</hi> or <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> who beleeue neither hel nor heauen, and I ſhould make a dolefull reuolution of my Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, to become of a Pilgrime of <hi>Loreto</hi> a robber &amp; thiefe.

Continuing his diſcourſe he tolde me: Friend <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> I would know this of you: I greatly commend your courage, and am not deceaued in the opinion I haue of your vertue.

I cannot (quoth he) fall into the handes of any enemies whome I feare ſo much as theſe, being that theſe do often kill both body and ſoule. As we were vpon theſe termes, the boy of my chamber, brought me a loaf, &amp; a peece of biefe for my dinner: <hi>Tristram</hi> went out of my chamber; I paſſed all that after dinner in prayers and ſighes, deſiring of God light and direction, that in ſo dangerous a company, I might do nothing againſt his honour, and that if I ſhould ſuffer any thing, it might be without my fault, and with perſeuerance in his holy loue: I prayed alſo hartily for good <hi>Tristram</hi> that he might happily ridde himſelfe from thoſe bandes, &amp; for all the troupe that God would inſpire their mynd to liue better.

The boye of my chamber came to call me, and brought me to a ſtable, where they brought me a Curtali ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with a ſadle of warre, and well furniſhed, and bad me mount, without ſaying any more, or giuing me any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; I mounted guirded with my Pilgrimes weed, &amp; with my beads, which I had about my necke for a ſcarfe, and my Pilgrimes ſtaffe, &amp; euery man laughed to ſee ſuch a Lance-Knight, and ſo reſolute in their company: ſo we parted in haſt without our ſupper, and walked foure houres in great ſilence, often ſtaying to harken or attend one another, &amp; we wrought our way through very thicke woodes, and hard to trauerſe, and were many tymes fayne to paſſe a row, in little by-paths, where ſix men in ambuſhment might haue defeated vs all.

                  </note> There came once a certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to this holy place, loaden with many ſinnes, and not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring greatly to diſcharge himſelfe,<note place="margin">A great ſinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed from the holy Cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell.</note> he entred into the Church to enter alſo with other Pilgrimes into the Chapell, but as he ſet his foot vpon the ground, behold a terrible Shape re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented it ſelfe againſt him, and draue him backe with a fearefull countenance, as with a ſtrong wynd. His conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce told him ſtraight that his ſins had placed that porter there;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:16410:163"/> ſo he went to confeſſion, but as the Prieſt to whome he came, perceaued that he was not well prepared, and that he had not ſearched well his Conſcience, ſince he had remayned many yeares in the filth of all ſorts of ſinnes, he counſelled him to go to the Chapell, and recommend himſelfe to God, and the glorious Virgin, to make a good examen of all his life paſt, the better to remember his ſinnes &amp; confeſſe them. He went thither, but becauſe it was not yet with a ſincere hart, vndertaking this examen and confeſſion rather to auoid ſhame then ſinne, the former disfigured ſhape did forbid him entrance againe; then he perceaued that this was don of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and was touched with a liuely ſorrow and repentance of his ſinnes, conceauing a full and firme purpoſe to do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance heereafter and liue better. And ſo hauing duely reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred himſelfe of his ſinnes, he went to the feet of the Prieſt, and made a generall Confeſſion, teſtifying with teares and ſobbes, the truth of his Contrition, &amp; the change of his ſoule, &amp; was abſolued by the Prieſt, who bad him go preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with a good courage, to the holy Place, ſaying that he ſhould not be repelled: he went therefore the third tyme hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and aſhamed, yea alſo fearing that it would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſo great a ſinner as he was, to enter into the houſe where God, and his greateſt Saints haue corporally dwelt, and which now ſo many Saints frequent: but God by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of the B. Virgin, permitted his humility to enter into his ſanctuary, as before he repelled his preſumption.</p>
               <p>It may be that many ſinners haue entred there, and doe enter without difficulty, and their condition is neuer the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet this one example might ſerue for a paterne to vs, and all other Pilgrimes, and to teach all Chriſtians, that to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their pilgrimage duely, they ſhould endeauour and intend the amendement of their life, and that to liue well they muſt forſake ſinne, and commit it no more, &amp; do good good workes: <hi>The good Tree bringeth forth good fruite,</hi>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.17</note> and the tree which bringeth not forth good fruite is not good. Your diſcourſe is true (ſaith the Merchant) but for vs it is very hard, I may ſay impoſſible, to abſtaine from ſinne, by reaſon of our vocation. Syr (ſayth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) in euery vocation and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:16410:164"/> in euery good action there is difficulty, and will you not graunt me, that it is as eaſy to be a good Chriſtian, as to be a good Merchant? Yes verily, quoth <hi>Gratian.</hi> Nay I aſſure my ſelfe (ſayth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) that you will confeſſe it to be much more eaſy; for there are a thouſand and a thouſand men who are good Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that would neuer make good Merchants: It is then eaſier to abſtaine from ſinne, and be a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, then to traficke as a good Merchant; how do you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke it ſo hard, as impoſſible for a Merchant to abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne, and liue honeſtly?</p>
               <p>I compare not the vocation of a Chriſtian, quoth <hi>Gratia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> with that of a Merchant, for I confeſſe the firſt is eaſier, but my meaning is,<note place="margin">It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſerue God and the world</note> that the firſt is meruailouſly hindred by the ſecond, and I remember I haue heard our Preachers ſay, it was impoſſible to ſerue two maiſters, God, and the World. And they called Riches, Thornes, by which the good ſeed of Gods word is choaked, whereof followeth that the eſtate of merchandiſe which attendeth to the world, and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for her end but wealth, is a great ſtoppe and hindrance to Chriſtian life. It is our Sauiour (ſayth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) who ſaith, it is impoſſible to ſerue two maiſters, and compareth Riches to Thornes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24</note> but this rule, and this Parable do not condemne the eſtate of Merchants, nor riches neither (for both before, and ſince the comming of our Sauiour, there were many Merchants,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 13.</note> and rich men too, good ſeruants of God) they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne only the folly of thoſe who calling themſelues Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that is, ſeruants of God, and diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt, will alſo haue the World for their maiſter, obeying and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it; who ſay, they ſerue God, and ſuffer themſelues to be carryed away by riches, who behold heauen with their left eye, and earth with their right, who take on both ſides, and finally who ſaile to Eaſt and Weſt both at once. Our Sauiour then ſayth not, that it is impoſſible to be a good Chriſtian &amp; a good Merchant, but only ſheweth it to be impoſſible to ſet their loue vpon the World, and earthly goods, and withall worke their ſaluation; which is very true doctrine, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the loue of the world &amp; auarice that croſſeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian vertue, &amp; not the eſtate of a Mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And in that ſenſe
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:16410:164"/> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth: <hi>They that will become rich, fall into temptation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; the ſnares of the Diuell, and into many foolish and hurtfull deſires, which drowne men in destruction and perdition; for Couetiſe is the root of all euill.</hi> So that, if the Merchant driue away all auarice and couetouſnes from his ſhoppe, he ſhall receaue no more impediment of doing well, by his eſtate, then the Iudge doth by his office, or the Souldier by warre.</p>
               <p>Friend Pilgrime (quoth the other Merchant) you haue touched the point,<note place="margin">A man may be a good Chriſtian &amp; a good Mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t both.</note> for doubtleſſe if the Merchant be not worldly or couetous, he may be a good Chriſtian; but how many ſuch doe you ſee? In my opinion it is as eaſy to find a white Crow, or a blacke Swan, or a Pike without a bone, as a Merchant without Couetiſe. Syr (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) will you condemne all Merchants of that fault? And Syr (quoth the Merchant) can you name me one Merchant who would not gaine, and be richer ſtill? Syr (replyed <hi>Lazarus</hi>) it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other matter to haue a deſire to gaine honeſtly, and make a reaſonable profit of ones mony and paines, &amp; another thing to be couetous; for the ſecond ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſtand with a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conſcience; the firſt pertaineth to his eſtate, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth not a good Merchant, but that he may be a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian alſo. For a well ordered deſire to get his liuing, and to gaine by buying and ſelling, neuer compelleth any man to do any thing againſt Gods law; but auarice will lay his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on all, and will fill his pouch with all manner of gaine. It wil make him corrupt his ware, take vſury, loue his ſhop better then the Church, his counting-houſe better then the Altar, and a reckoning, better then a Maſſe, or a ſermon.<note place="margin">Effects of couetiſe.</note> It will make him looſe his ſoule and heauen, rather then his earthly riches. It is auarice therfore, that alwayes corrupteth the merchant and his eſtate, but not that the eſtate is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the obſeruation of the lawes of God. And if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulty of working ſaluation in this calling, beſides auarice, it is a common caſe to all eſtates; for in euery one ſhall a man meet with difficultyes, which may turne him from the way of well doing, if he will ſuffer himſelfe to be turned out: In being a King, a Iudge, a Captaine, and the like. There are the like alſo in euery age: Youth hath her
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:16410:165"/> faultes,<note place="margin">All eſtats and ages haue their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultyes.</note> and old age hath hers, and other ages haue theirs: but as for theſe obſtacles we do not condemne all eſtates &amp; ages, ſo muſt they not make vs condemne the eſtate of Merchants; for theſe are not impoſſibilityes to liue well, (for ſo all the world muſt become Religious) but matter to merit in euery vocation. For the more difficulty there is in any worke, ſo much more is the vertue, and reward, and glory in ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">No eſtate without difficulty.</note>To thinke we may exerciſe any eſtate in this mortall life without difficulty, is to imagine a Sea without tempeſt, or a Warre without encounters. The Religious themſelues, who at one blow haue broken the greateſt difficultyes, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting from them the baggage of the world, and haue entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched themſelues within the counſels of our Sauiour, out of the wyndes and ſtormes of this worldly ſea, are not exempt from all difficultyes; for they carry their fleſh about them, which is a ſeminary of many troubles, and the Diuell goeth euery where,<note place="margin">Euery man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth his Croſſe. <hi>Math.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Marc.</hi> 8.34.</note> who alwayes cutteth worke for our infirmity, and euery where ech man carryeth his Croſſe; for that, is a decree pronounced by the mouth of our great Maiſter. It is true, that all do not profit thereby, becauſe they carry their Croſſe ouerthwart without merit, as without patience. Syr ſayth the Merchant, if difficulty make merit and glory, then our condition, and that of worldly men is in better caſe then the Religious, for that we haue more difficulty to be ſaued without compariſon. I anſwere (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men haue more difficultyes and letres of ſaluation then Religious, yet for al that they haue no more merit, but much leſſe, becauſe they breed the cauſes of their owne difficulty, and faſten the fetters on their owne feet. Whereas the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious do ouercome at one blow all the chiefe difficultyes, pulling themſelues out of the preſſe of the world with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute mind, forſaking all things, to ſubmit themſelues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſeruice of God, which are too great exploites of a noble mind, the one of fortitude, and the other of Charity; and if after, they haue leſſe difficulty to liue well, they miſſe not therefore of more merit; for it is the fruit of their victory, and a continuall prayſe of vertue to them, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:16410:165"/> to haue paſſed through the bowells of their enemies, and an increaſe of glory, to haue choſen ſo noble a field to fight in, and therein to gaine the crowne of euerlaſting glory. The excellency of an eſtate doth not conſiſt in the difficulty, but rather in the goodnes and beauty of her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Wherein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lency of an eſtate.</note> as in the foundation, and of the end thereof, as in the crowne. Therefore the vocation of <hi>Theology</hi> is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of <hi>Phiſicke,</hi> becauſe it hath a higher ſubiect which is God, and a more noble end, which is the health of the ſoule; wheras Phyſicke reſpecteth onely the body and the health thereof; though phyſike perhaps may haue more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty then the other. Alſo when the difficulty cometh of the excellency of the thing, it is greater merit to ouercome it, as warfare is more laudable then tillage of the ground, becauſe it is more difficult by reaſon of the greater worthines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But if the difficulty ariſe of the fault of the party,<note place="margin">What dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficulty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth merit.</note> it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth no praiſe with it, &amp; therefore he that accuſtometh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to good cheere, is not therefore more to be praiſed if he faſt with difficulty, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Religious which faſteth with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, becauſe he is vſed thereunto, but rather this facility to faſt turneth to his greater commendation; no more nor leſſe then he that hauing learned to play well of a muſicall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, playeth with eaſe and facility, doth an action more commendable, then an Apprentiſe who doth the ſame with difficulty. What more merit, ſay you then, ſhall a merchant haue to ſurmount his difficulties? I anſwer, he ſhal haue more then another merchant who ſhould ouercome leſſe difficulty in the ſame exerciſe; alſo he that hath reſiſted more temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, more deſires, more occaſions of doing ill, ſhall haue more merit, which muſt be vnderſtood of all other perſons of like vocation. For example amongſt diuers religious lyuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one rule, he that mortifieth his ill inclination with more force, that ſuffereth more, and laboureth with more charity; amongſt diuers Chriſtian ſouldiours, he that fighteth more valiantly, with more incommodities; amongſt diuers Iudges he that amongſt moſt croſſes of iuſtice performeth Iuſtice, &amp; ſo of others. The concluſion then is, that the true Religious hath more merit becauſe he ſurmonts greater difficulty, and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:16410:166"/> becauſe he doth more worthy actions, and the merchant not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the impediment of his eſtate, may be a good merchant, &amp; a good Chriſtian, both traficke gainfully &amp; liue holily if he will.

For the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby he may gaine a hundred for one, and buy with the gaine thereof the kingdome of heauen. My Maiſters do you deſire a more gainful traficke, or more faithfull vſury then this? In truth (quoth <hi>Gratian</hi>) your diſcourſe ſhutteth our mouth to all excuſes, and doth encourage vs to do better hereafter; and I would to God we were in that liberty, that I thinke you are in, without charge of wife and children, we would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps vſe another kind of traficke, leſſe expoſed to the danger of the ſoule, &amp; more profitable. But we are bound, and haue beene of thoſe, who feele not the weight of our fetters, but when they hinder our walking, and when we repent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out profit, the choice we haue made without prudence.

To gaine an hundred for one, and a kingdome, and that of heauen, is it not a rich traficke, and an vſury both fruitfull and honourable? Gentlemen, if I feared not to be troubleſome vnto you, I would tell you a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hiſtory of this matter, but it is inough for you that are inſtructed in a Chriſtian ſchoole, to haue touched it in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Syr, ſayd they, you haue ſhewed vs ſo good ſtuffe, that the more we ſee, the more we deſire to buy, we will take it of credit, and I pray you, do not depriue vs of the ware of this ſtory. If you be weary get vp on one of our horſes, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry a better charge, nor a worthier horſeman. I am yet (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) very well diſpoſed on my legges, and ready to ſerue you with theſe little bribes, ſeeing you take pleaſure in them. The hiſtory is. There was in <hi>Niſibu</hi> a towne of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> a certaine Chriſtian woman marryed to a Paynim:<note place="margin">A me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable hiſtory.</note> this fellow had fifty Crownes in his purſe, and a great deſire he had to multiply them, and ſayd one day to his wife: Wife, I would fayne find a way to make profit of the ſiluer we haue, for if we take not heed it will be ſhortly all ſpent, one peece after another, we muſt put it forth to intereſt. The good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man anſwered, I am of your opinion husband, ſo that the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury be good: as high as we can find any, quoth he, thirty yea fifty in the hundred: you muſt giue it then, ſayd ſhe, to the God of the Chriſtians. Shal we haue ſo much of him, quoth
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:16410:167"/> he? And more too (anſwered his wife) if you will. We will haue no more (quoth he) let vs giue it him hardly: but where ſhall we find him? You muſt (ſayth ſhe) deliuer it to his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers: and where dwell they? Come you with me, ſayd his wife, and bring the mony: &amp; ſhe brought him from thence to the Church of the Chriſtians, and ſhewing him a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Poore which begged almes at the gate: Behold (ſayth ſhe) theſe are the treaſurers of the God of the Chriſtians, to whome you muſt deliuer your mony to vſury. He being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather abaſhed; Marry wife, quoth he, theſe are but ill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Treaſurers, do you not ſee that they are poore beggers, who haue neither credit, nor any ground in bargayning, &amp; when they haue eaten the principall, who ſhall pay vs our intereſt? Nay, ſayth ſhe, we muſt not looke to their wealth or fortune, but to the credit and ſufficiency of their Maiſter, who receaueth the money by their handes, and rendreth faythfully, to all that giueth them, and neuer yet deceaued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Belieue me only, &amp; giue it them without feare; I would dy rather then deceaue you: without feare, ſayth he, I cannot thus deliuer our mony, wherein conſiſteth all our wealth, but yet vpon thy word I will deliuer it. And ſo ſaying, he began to diſtribute his fifty peeces, ſhaking and trembling, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Wife if he muſt not taken an obligation of them: to whome ſhe anſwered, that it was not needfull, and ſo they returned home. Three months being expired, he ſayd: Wife, behold the firſt quarter is come, ſhall we finger any mony to liue on? Yea, ſayth ſhe, go to the ſame place where you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it: he went, and found there ſome of thoſe beggers, to whome he had giuen his mony, and diuers new beſides; he ſtayed to ſee if they would ſay any thing to him of the matter, and he ſaw that inſteed of giuing him any thing, they reached forth their hand, and begged more inſtantly then they did before: for the old beggers had told the other, that this man was a great almes-giuer, and very charitable, and that not long ſince he had giuen them a bountifull liberality, in ſuch ſort as they lookt to receaue ſo much as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: whereas the good man had no ſuch meaning, but bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the credulity of his wife, in giuing him ſo bad counſell,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:16410:167"/> and his owne ſimplicity in hauing belieued her. Was not my wife (ſayd he in himſelfe) very venturous, to counſell me any ſuch courſe? And was not I a very foole, for letting my ſelfe be ruled and perſuaded by a woman? As he diſcourſed thus angerly, walking in the Church, he eſpied vpon the marble pauement, one of thoſe peeces of gold that he had giuen, and ſo he returned halfe pacifyed, and told his wife, that he had not ſeene this God of the Chriſtians, and that his treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were but poore officers, who were ſo farre from giuing me any thing, that they demanded more. Only I found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my feet one peece of that I gaue before. That was the God of Chriſtians, ſayd ſhe, who ſayd it there, with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible hand wherewith he gouerneth all the world. Well husband, ſayth ſhe, go I pray you, &amp; buy ſomething therwith for our ſupper, and haue confidence in the prouidence of God: he went to the Market, and brought among other prouiſion a Fiſh, and comming home gaue it his wife to dreſſe, who opening the belly, found therein a great Diamond of a moſt cleare and beautifull luſtre; ſhe wondered at it, without knowing the worth, ſhe ſhewed it her husband, who won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered alſo, knowing the valew as little as ſhe. When they had ſupped, he ſayd to his Wife: giue me that ſtone to ſell, perhaps we may get a Teſton for it. He tooke it, and went to a Ieweller, who had already ſhut his ſhoppe, and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him this ſtone to ſell: the Ieweller beheld it with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the beauty and bignes of the Diamond, as neuer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſeene the like before, and ſayd vnto him: Well, what ſhall I giue you for it? He anſwered, what pleaſeth you? The Ieweller told him he would giue him fiue Crownes; he that eſteemed the ſtone worth but two Teſtons, thought he moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, and ſayd, will you giue me ſo much indeed? The Ieweller alſo thought that his merchant ieſted with him, &amp; for his part mocked at his ſmall offer, and ſayd: I will giue you ten Crownes. The good man thinking he was mocked ſtill, ſayd neuer a word. The Ieweller offered twenty, after thirty, and ſeeing he anſwered nothing, he came vp to fifty, ſhewing by his ſpeach and faſhion, that he was in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. When he perceaued the Ieweller to ſpeake without ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:16410:168"/> he began to thinke that his Diamond was of a notable valew, and ſayd: Syr, you know better then I how much it is worth, and therefore without any more bidding, referre your ſelfe to reaſon, and giue me what a man of your eſtate would iudge it worth. The Ieweller was afraid, that he would haue gone to ſome other, and ſo he looſe that good bargaine, ſayd, what ſhall I giue then at a word? He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at all aduenture; you ſhall giue me (ſayth he) three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crownes without abating one groat. He tooke him at his word, and told him out three hundred Crownes in three hundred peeces. So he returned home loaden with mony, with an vnexpected ioy. His wife ſeeing him all ioyfull, &amp; thinking he had for his Diamond ſome Teſtons; demanded how much he had gotten for it: he caſt all the three hundred Crownes vpon the table, ſaying: Loe what they haue giuen me for my ſtone. Then ſayd his Wife: My good Husband, now confeſſe that the God of the Chriſtians, is faythfull and rich, and payeth his Creditours; you demanded but 50. in the hundred, and he hath giuen you three hundred for 50. And know you alſo, that this is nothing in reſpect of that he will giue you, if you will belieue in him, and become a Chriſtian. The good man opening his eyes at this miracle, and the wordes of his wife, cauſed himſelfe to be inſtructed in the Chriſtian Fayth, and being baptized liued afterward holily.</p>

The battaile began, the Weſel bit him by the taile, &amp; riſing with a iumpe, thought to haue bit him in the belly. The ſerpent was not yet hoate, and therfore wynded about but heauily, the Weſell went about nimbly, skipping here and there to faſten on the ſerpent, without being bitten her ſelfe. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by little and little waxed warme to the skirmiſh, and began already to ſwell in the necke, &amp; lifted one foot aboue the ground, ſhe turned and trayned, hiſſing and darting her tongue.</p>

The combat was doubtfull a while, but at laſt the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:16410:169"/> Weſell watched her aduerſary ſo well, that ſhe faſtened her teeth in his neecke, cloſe by his head, and held him ſo hard crying, and caſting her vrine, that the ſerpent hauing made many turnings, and ouer-turnings of his body in fighting with his head and taile, remayned dead vpon the place, and the little Weſel went conquerour out of the field, as it might ſeeme to eate rue againe. This combat greatly reioyced the company, &amp; <hi>Lazarus</hi> was halfe rauiſhed admiring the workes of God therein, hauing giuen ſo great a courage to ſo ſmall a creature, &amp; ſtrength to ouercome another ten times as bigge as her ſelfe.

               <p>SVCH was the meditation and prayer of <hi>Lazarus. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> and <hi>Vincent</hi> held the ſame points with other veines
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:16410:171"/> of deuotion. Their prayers ended they tooke a draught of wine, and would haue reckoned with their Hoſt, but he ſayd he would haue none of their ſiluer, himſelfe was rather in their debt, and ſo put in their hand the Crowne, which the Merchant had left the night before for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, of which himſelfe would take nothing, but reſtored it whole to them as their owne. They deſired him to beſtow it on other Pilgrimes that paſſed that way, or on the poore, ſaying they had God be thanked, good prouiſion, &amp; thanking him very hartily for his charity, they departed very well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and he remained much edified with their piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion. After they had ſayd their prayers for their iourney, and their beads, they began to diſcourſe of their meditation, whereupon <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſayd, he had had that night a dreame, that was all of warre, and wild beaſtes.</p>
               <p>He affirmed moreouer, that this tentation was the moſt liuely and goodly patterne of a combat that could be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,<note place="margin">An admi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

See you, on the other ſide, our good Redeemer, couered with the cloke of our infirme na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuffering himſelfe to be carryed by his enemy to bring him to confuſion? See you how his great humility, quickly pulled out the eyes of pride, which appeared by the ſecond aſſault, when Sathan ſayd vnto our Sauiour: <hi>If thou beest the ſonne of God, cast thy ſelfe downe?</hi> Which was the diſcourſe of a diſtracted ſpirit, ioyning a concluſion of phrenſy to an Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of Diuinity; for it is, as if he had ſayd: Thou art Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, do therefore an act of extreme infirmity; for that to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:16410:171"/> precipitate himſelfe is an act of a baſe and cowardly hart: he ſhould rather haue ſayd, if thou beeſt the ſonne of God, fly vp to heauen, or demand ſome ſuch thing which might haue ſhewed ſome worthy proofe of ſuch power, and might haue made ſome reaſonable illation. And do you not thinke that our Challengers haue been at the ſchoole of this diſtracted Skirmiſher,<note place="margin">Againſt Chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> when pricked with a point of honour (as they cal it) but in truth with a point of ſome phrenſy, they ſend let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of defiance to their enemies in theſe termes: If thou beeſt an honeſt man come try a ſword with me, that is, come ſhew a tricke of daſtardy, and caſt thy ſelfe downe togeather with me, into euerlaſting death and ignominy? And ſhould we not anſwere to the humming of ſuch a hornet: Go thy wayes ill aduiſed fond fellow, becauſe I am an honeſt man,<note place="margin">Duelliſts.</note> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thy defiance, as a ſummon proceeding out of the mouth of a frantike man, or ſcholler of Sathan, and the Diuells diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, not a Chriſtian Caualier? Moreouer what ſhame think you receaued this King of the children of pride, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming yet in the ſecond encounter more blind; and preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the victory in the third, he was reiected with theſe byting wordes, <hi>Get thee gone Sathan,</hi> pronounced with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, and anger of our victorious Sauiour, of whome he would haue beene adored on both knees.</p>
               <p>In truth (quoth <hi>Vincent</hi>) it was a meruailous combat in euery reſpect, and the victory notable; as alſo theſe two were the greateſt Captains that euer were, the one in power and wiſedome, the other in ſtrength and malice, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you could better penetrate then I. I ſtayed with great contentation in the firſt words of our Sauiour, wherewith he did beare off the firſt aſſault of the enemy, ſaying:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not only by bread, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> That is, as I haue heeretofore heard our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſay, by whatſoeuer God will nouriſh vs with all. For in this anſwere, I perceaued the wiſedome, goodnes, and power of God, who both could, would, and knew how to giue meanes to liue, not only to man, but to all creatures, whereof ſome are nouriſhed with herbes, ſome with fruits, ſome with water, others with wind. Man hath all the world
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:16410:172"/> and all creatures for his prouiſion, and ſometyme is miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſuſtained,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.</note> euen by the beaſtes themſelues, as <hi>Elias</hi> by the Crow, yea euen by direction of beaſtes, ſuch as are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; pernicious to the life of man, as not long ſince I heard a notable example of a Pilgrime, who was nouriſhed diuers wayes with a ſtone, which ſerpents had ſhewed vnto him. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> knoweth wel this ſtory; for he told it once in good company, and if it pleaſe him to renew the memory thereof vnto vs, he ſhall ſo farre ſolace our way. Truly (ſayth <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>) looking vpon <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> you may not refuſe this liberall offer. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> anſwered, ſeeing that <hi>Vincent</hi> is in company, and hath ſo good a memory, as to remember a hiſtory that I tould foure years ſince, me thinkes he ſhould rather pleaſure and recreate the company therewith. I remember that I haue forgot it, replyed <hi>Vincent,</hi> if you will haue me recite it, firſt help my forgetfullnes, and after I will do my beſt. I ſee well (quoth <hi>Theodoſius) Lazarus</hi> is lead away by <hi>Vincent,</hi> and I muſt be condemned by them both to tell this hiſtory; I am content to beare the ſentence, but if I performe it ill, your eares ſhall beare the paine and pennance.</p>
               <p>If I remember well (ſayth he) then heare it as I learned it of that venerable Prelate <hi>Iohn Fisher</hi> an Engliſhman Biſhop of <hi>Rochester,</hi>

Ooecolam.</note> hoping there to find the right way, where if night ſhould ſurpriſe him, he might alſo find ſome corner to couer himſelfe from wind and ſnow, but looking on euery part, he found no iſſue or way to get out, all the ground being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with ſnow. For his bed, he eſpied a little hole on the right hand, wrought naturally within the Rocke, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle plaine before it, there he caſt himſelfe as into his graue, not looking to liue; for he had neither weapons nor muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuſtaine the ſiege of two ſo great enemies as cold &amp;
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:16410:172"/> hunger, which already began to buckle with him, and muſt needes ſhortly preſſe him without mercy, and take him with out ſtriking a ſtroke. The Moone was at the full, &amp; by good fortune began to ſhine; the heauens waxing cleare a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſet himſelfe ſupperles in his bed of ſtone, he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked almoſt till midnight, when he ſaw a troupe of great Serpents, which came towardes his denne, trayning al along the ſnow; he was frighted at this ſight, and bleſſed himſelfe, and did not thinke that they had beene ſerpents indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not conceaue any naturall cauſe that ſhould make them leaue their holes at this tyme, and thus trayne vpon the ſnow; and it came in his mind to thinke, that it was ſome illuſion of the nights fancies, or perhaps ſome wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſpirits, who came in that figure to diſquiet him; ſo he bleſſed himſelfe againe, and recommended himſelfe with all his hart to God, &amp; the B. Virgin. The ſerpents approached and came to a ſtone, cloſe by his denne, they go about it, &amp; after they come to it, and licked it. He ſate looking when they would leape on him, entring into his denne to deuoure him. But when they had taryed a while licking the ſtone, they returned the ſame way they came. He thanked God, that he was deliuered from this feare, and ſlept a little the reſt of the night, and was all the next day without eating or ſeeing any thing, but the whitenes of the earth, and the light of heauen.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond, and third night at the ſame houre, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents came againe, and hauing done as they did before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. Then he perſuaded himſelfe that they were very ſerpents, but he could not tell the cauſe why they ſhould licke the ſtone. In the meane tyme he was almoſt ſtarued with hunger, and thought that perharps thoſe beaſtes did ſhew him, what he ſhould do to ſuſtaine himſelfe. Therfore he goeth to the ſtone, putteth his mouth to it, and licketh it; and as ſoone as he had licked it (a ſtrange thing) he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſtrengthned both againſt hunger and cold, as if he had taken ſome reſtoratiue or ſome ſtrange meat, and in this ſort he ſuſtayned and defended himſelfe all the winter long and a part of the ſpring, vntill the moneth of April, when the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:16410:173"/> ſnow beginning to melte, and the wayes to open, he heard the voice of paſſengers whome he followed, and ſet himſelfe in way with them to finiſh his iourney. Behould what you demanded of me; and ſurely <hi>Vincent</hi> had good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to note the prouidence of God in thoſe wordes of our Sauiour; for it is eaſy to ſee in this example, that God is all mercifull and almighty, hauing alwayes care of his creaturs, &amp; able to maintaine them, not with bread only, but of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall pleaſe him, yea euen with ſtones if he will. And therefore Sathan, though he were crafty on the one ſide, in giuing the aſſault where he thought likelyeſt to haue ſped,<note place="margin">The folly of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</note> he was notwithſtanding a great foole on the other ſide, in thinking it neceſſary to turne ſtones into bread to ſuſtain the body, it being as eaſy for the Sonne of God, to draw nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhement out of a ſtone without bread, as to turne a ſtone into bread for nouriſhment. Loe (quoth <hi>Vincent</hi>) you are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of your hiſtory, and I am contented. Truly (ſayth <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>) you haue reaſon to be contented, and I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall haue ſo good a dinner againe to day, as <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> hath giuen vs; for beſides the ſpirituall refection, he hath giuen vs alſo a good leſſon, teaching vs to expect with great fayth and confidence the aſſiſtance of our Sauiour, both for body and ſoule in all our neceſſityes.</p>
               <p>But, ſayth <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> ſeeing you would breake your faſt vpon that little I had in the ſacke of my memory, bring you forth alſo the narration of your dreame you had the laſt night: you demand (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) but a homely diſh. Such as will ſerue for Pilgrims and footmen, anſwered <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> If you will vndertake, replyed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to giue the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof as a good ſauce, I am content to performe your wil.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

(ſayth <hi>Theodoſius.</hi>) How can you miſſe (ſaith he) to interpret a thing ſo notorious and cleare? Who knoweth not that there is warre amongſt men, and warre amongſt beaſtes, and that diuers ſaile vpon the ſea, and walke vpon the land? Truly (ſaith <hi>Lazarus) Vincent</hi> hath reaſon to laugh, for I dreamed nothing, but that euery man ſeeth without dreaming, and therefore <hi>Theodoſius</hi> either laugh with him, or find ſome ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous interpretation to keepe you from laughing.</p>
               <p>I thinke (ſaith <hi>Theodoſius</hi>) that the moſt part of dreams are grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things that are in being &amp; which we haue ſeen.<note place="margin">The fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For my part (ſaith <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi>) I thinke that the matter of this dreame, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did wiſely iudge, came of the ſubiect of his meditation, &amp; that it ſignifieth ſome other warre, then the ordinary of men and beaſtes, but I cannot expound it in particular: that pertaineth vnto you <hi>Lazarus,</hi> for I doubt not, but as God hath put this dreame into your fantaſy, ſo alſo he hath in ſome ſort writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the interpretation thereof in your vnderſtanding.

Our good Lord hath viſited me, Syr <hi>Lazarus:</hi> yeſterday a little after we came to this Towne, I had news that my wife was dead, and a little ſonne I had, the hope of my houſe, and old age. I thought little of this accident, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> talking with you, I ſayd that were it not for the hinderance of my family, I would willingly haue ſerued God, with that liberty as you do; and in ſaying this, he began to weep, and ſobbe, that he could ſpeak no further. <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſayd vnto him: Syr <hi>Gratian,</hi> you haue loſt nothing which you ſhould not haue loſt once, this is but a little preuenting the tyme,<note place="margin">Death is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon debt.</note> and perhaps you haue gayned much heerein; for how know you, what fortune would haue followed your ſonne, as if inſteed of being the ſtaffe of your old age, he might haue tormented and vndone you, your houſe, &amp; himſelfe, as hath fallen out to many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? And if you had beene ſure of his vertuous courſe, God would haue him, and beſtow on him a farre better inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, then you could haue left him, or at the leaſt haue giuen you ſome other ſupporter inſteed of your ſonne. He tooke nothing but his owne, he gaue him you with this condition to take him againe when he would, and now he hath taken him, it is his right, and his will, to the which you neither may, nor can reſiſt. It reſteth only for you to haue Chriſtian patience, and to profit by your loſſe. <hi>Gratian</hi> being ſomewhat aſſwaged, reſumed his diſcourſe, and ſayd: Well ſeeing it hath pleaſed him thus to afflict me, in taking from me what was deereſt in this world, I reſolue to caſt my ſelfe wholy into his armes, and heale my wound by that hand that made it. I haue now no band that bindeth me to the ſeruice of the world, and hindreth my liberty to ſerue God withall my hart, &amp; to liue a true Pilgrime vpon earth: it is longe ſince the world did ſtinke vnto my noſe, and my experience of her infidelity, hath breed in me a hatred, and loathing to deale with her, &amp; this is the very matter that I would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſult with you, and take aduiſe about retyring my ſelfe from vanity, to ſerue God in aſſurance all the reſt of my life; and I coniure you in the name of God, and by the zeale which I know you
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:16410:175"/> haue to his honour, and the ſaluation of ſoules, to aſſiſt me with your direction. <hi>Lazarus</hi> told him in few wordes: Syr <hi>Gratian,</hi> I am of all other the vnfitteſt to inſtruct you, though I dare place my ſelfe among the firſt in harty affection tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes you. I will tell you notwithſtanding freely, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould in this accident a great prouidence of God towardes you; for I doubt not but he hath ſtriken you with this blow, to bring you out of the gulfe, where you were in danger to haue made ſhipwracke of your ſoule, &amp; me thinks you ſhould not call affliction the death of two dearely beloued, but a double benefit, being vnto your ſelfe a doore with two hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to enter at your eaſe into the reſt of Paradiſe in this life, and of eternall felicity in the next: he had prepared and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed your hart heereunto, by making you taſt the bitternes of the world, he graued therein by little and little a deſire to leaue the vanityes thereof: now he vntyeth your feet and your handes, and openeth you a way to execute the deſire he hath giuen you. For that you demand my counſell, you haue diuers Religious men of great learning and conſcience, more capable then I without compariſon, that may aduiſe you in this affaire, yet ſeeing it pleaſeth you to addreſſe your ſelfe to the meaneſt, by way of friendſhip, I will tell you as a friend, that if you haue a mind to leaue the world, &amp; to ſerue God withall your hart, you are in a good way, and you may your ſelfe alone decide the matter with Almighty God. The matter is extremely commendable, the intention holy, the concluſion cleare, what ſhould you conſult? In high and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall enterpriſes there is more need of execution, then of conſultation. All that you can doubt of, is, what choice to make of Religions; for euery Religion is not for euery body. You ſay well (quoth <hi>Gratian</hi>) and this is the principall point,<note place="margin">How to chooſe a Religion.</note> wherein I deſire your direction. Heerein (ſayth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) you muſt firſt take heed, to chooſe a Religion well ordered; for to go out of the world into a Religion debaucht &amp; diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, is to leaue Aegypt, and ioyne with the murmurers in the deſart, there to be exterminated by ſerpents, or ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe into the ground. There is nothing more goodly, or excellent in the Church of God, then a Religious compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:16410:176"/> walking according to their rules, towardes perfection; neither is there a confuſion more pernicious, then a diſſolute and vnruled congregation, hauing nothing of Religion but the title and the habit, and therefore in the firſt place, you muſt chooſe a Religion, that keepeth well its Order.</p>
               <p>Secondly, among many Religions well reformed, you muſt chooſe that which hath the moſt worthy &amp; noble end,<note place="margin">The hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſt and the beſt meanes.</note> or rules of greateſt perfection, and more Apoſtolicall, which hath more meanes and help to faſhion, and frame the inward man, to cultiuate the ſoule, and plant therein the moſt noble vertues;<note place="margin">S.

                  </note> that contributeth moſt to the ſeruice of God, and profit of our Neighbours, and therfore that which attendeth to Contemplation, is to be preferred before that which dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth only with Action, and that which tendeth to both, is the better.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A mans owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>In the third place, he that will make his choiſe, muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue whereunto himſelfe is more apt, and inclined to God-ward; ſome imbrace auſterity of life, others action, others contemplation: he ſhall therefore haue regard not only to the perfection of the rule, but alſo to his owne capacity, and ſhal thereupon conferre with God by prayers, and with ſome good ſpirituall Father by conference, to take reſolution of the beſt. And to come to your ſelfe in particular, if you haue already caſt your mind to any Religion, which hath the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd qualities, I aduiſe you to ſet in good order your wordly buſines, and being rid of all impediments, to confine your ſelfe as ſoone as you can to the ſeruice of God.

And moſt of them that ſeeme men, are ſo but in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for within they haue the ſoules of thoſe Beaſtes I named.

And <hi>Gratian</hi> going forward, I will not deny (ſayth he) but that there be ſome ſmall number of men of knowledge, and piety, for whoſe ſake God ſuffereth the Towne to ſtand, but they are as ſtangers and Pilgrimes. At theſe wordes <hi>Theodoſius</hi> began to ſpeake, and ſay to <hi>Vincent:</hi> Behold the whole interpretation, but he permitted the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to conclude, who ſayd: Well Maiſters, I will eſteeme you happy, that you haue directed the wayes of your Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage better then I haue done, I entreat you, by your holy prayers, to obtaine for me, that I may walke hereafter ſo happily, and ſo haſtily performe the reſt of my way in this mortall life, that God may be glorified, &amp; the repoſe of my ſoule aſſured, vnder the ſhadow of his mercy. <hi>Lazarus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering for all; we depart from this Towne (ſayth he) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with your generous reſolution, with hope that God will preſerue you from all the danger of this wicked world, and accompliſh with a full meaſure, the good deſire he hath giuen you: we will beare in our hart the remembrance of your loue and friendſhip, and will place you in the middeſt of our beſt prayers. This being ſayd, they imbraced, and tooke leaue one of another. <hi>Gratian</hi> put into the hand of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> ſome peeces of mony, deſiring him to take it to defray the charges of their iourney: but he would none, ſaying he

So they walked vntill night without any diſturbance or ill fortune, and tooke vp their lodging for that night at a little towne called <hi>Bon-rencontre,</hi> three leagues from the place wher they dined. After they had ſupped and ſayd their accuſtomed prayers, they did conferre vpon their morning meditation, which was the calling of the firſt fiue Diſciples of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in three points.</p>

                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:16410:180"/> found an other: this was the almes which the good hoſt of the Country farme had hidden in their bagge without ſaying any thing.

               <p>The Nightingales which were in great number in that wood, began to ſing, ſtriuing as it were who ſhould do beſt; and to make a conſort of muſike with diuerſe tunes and quires; and it ſeemed they had warning before hand to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelues to ſing the beſt aires, they had in their bookes of nature, whileſt the Pilgrimes did eat. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was rauiſhed, and a man might ſee in his countenance, that his ſoule ſong praiſes to the Creator, moued by the ſongs of theſe little birds. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Vincent</hi> alſo tooke more pleaſure to refreſh their ſpirit with this muſicke, than in feeding their body with meate and drinke, and they admired three of theſe, aboue all the reſt; for in recording and anſwering one to another, they made an admirable melody to the eare, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any variety of tunes of accord, or voices, which they did not furniſh: they ſong by nature, and did meruailouſly well mingle their flattes and ſharpes together, now in the Dorian and the Lydian tune, to bring men aſleep and refreſh them, now in the Phrygian and Martiall, as it were giuing a ſigne of battell: They ſong the treble with a clere ſound and a high, and after the baſe, with a throt ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out, quauering with aſcendants &amp; deſcendants fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus theſe good Pilgrimes tooke their recreation, but they were not aduiſed of a certaine Robber, lurking as a ſpy behind them who cared not one whit for the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales ſongs, but rather for the Pilgrimes purſes, which he
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:16410:180"/> thought had beene full of Crownes, by reaſon of what he ouerheard a little before, and watched to worke them an ill turne, and harkened for no more but to know which way they went, and ſo croſſe their way, &amp; cut their purſes, and perhaps their throates too. Hauing taken their refection, &amp; ſayd grace, they continued their way to go lodge at <hi>Meuriers,</hi> which was 3. leagues off. The Rogue failed not, ſo ſoone as they were departed, to go ſeeke his companions, who were ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or eight in ambuſh a quarter of a mile off in the wood, he aduertiſed them that he had diſcouered three Pilgrimes loaden with gold and ſiluer, who went towardes <hi>Meuriers;</hi> and that they ſhould arme themſelues with their beſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, for that he iudged by their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, that they were ſtout fellowes of their handes, and harts. So they departed in poſt to intrappe the Pilgrimes halfe a league oft in the wood; but God preſerued them, for comming to a croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way parted into three wayes, they commended themſelues to the B. Virgin, that ſhe would leade them into the right; and inſteed of taking the way to <hi>Meuriers,</hi> where the theeues lay in waite for them, they tooke another, which lead to an Hermitage, where there liued after the manner of the old Monks of Aegypt, a man of moſt holy Conuerſation.</p>

A good old man who ſerued for porter and clarke to the good Hermite to ſay Maſſe, and to go a begging, was then in his little garden ſet, before the the houſe on a little banke; they came to him and ſaluted him courteouſly, and he did the like to them, and with a friendly and kind countenance ſaid vnto them, My good brethren haue you not miſled of your way?

               <p>I will go tell him ſo much (quoth the good man) and went in where he met the good old Father co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming towards them, knowing of the Pilgrimes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming by ſecret reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo they made towards him, and he towards them, and imbraced them with a ſhew of great charity. They were all much moued to ſee ſo venerable an old man, all white, yet right vp and vigorous, with his long lockes beating vpon his ſhoulders, and a long beard, in a rugge gowne girded with a thicke rope, buttened with a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle of the ſame ſtuffe, they ſaw not the hayre he wore next his skin. He ſaid vnto them: My good brethren God be with you; The good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell hath brought you hither, for my comfort, and for your owne good; I haue long deſired to ſee ſome Deuote of the B. Virgin the mother of my Sauiour; She hath directed you by a ſecret way to this little deſert, and hath withall deliuered you from two immine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dangers. The one from theeues, who this after dinner thinking you had more mony then you haue did watch for you in the right way to haue ſpoiled &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you; he that aduertiſed them was one of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who lay hidden behind the fountaine, when you opened your bags for bread: they remembred then well what they ſaid, when they found their peeces of gold, and they harkened to the good old man as a Prophet, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his diſcourſe. The other danger (ſaith he) you ſhall know by and by: let vs now go ſalute our Sauiour &amp; the B.

The Hermit lifted them vp ſtreight, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſaid vnto him: My reuerend Father, we need not diſcourſe vnto you what hath hapened vnto vs in diuers countries during our ſeauen yeares pilgrimage, for as we ſee, God hath reuealed it vnto you, as well as my proper name, which I changed into <hi>Lazarus,</hi> thinking my ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be called <hi>Aime-dieu</hi> (that is a I ouer of God) not louing him with that perfection and purity I ſhould; &amp; haue taken the name of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to remember that I am poore and needy. The name is good (ſaith the hermit) and the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is better; and ſpeaking to them all three, My good bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſaith he, I will not put you to the paine to recount your fortunes, it ſufficeth me to know, and thanke God the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, that you haue ſuffered much for his name, and that you are Deuotes of the B. Virgin, the moſt glorious mother of his Sonne. As he ſaid this, the porter perceiued a far oft a great troupe of horſemen, who galloped with all fury to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the hermitage, and he cried out, my Father, we are vndone. Feare not (quoth the Hermit) not being any whit moued, we are ſtronger then they: they were aboue fifty, carying a cloud of duſt, which their horſes raiſed in the aire. As they came neere the hermitage, they went thrice about it, crying and ſhouting like mad men, and after they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whence they came, without doing any more harme. This is (ſaid the Hermit) a company of ſouldiers, pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Captaine of that towne whence you came, who ſeeke nothing els but to hurt men, or at leaſt ſcare them. And God did you a faire grace inſpiring you not to ſtay at <hi>Mondeuil</hi>

Bleſſed be God, and the B. Virgin (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) for this fauour &amp; all others we haue receaued from his holy hand, as well which we know not, as which we know. Well (ſaith the Hermit) that you may haue occaſion to praiſe yet more hartily that ſupreme bounty, I will tell you the qualities of another Citty, the mother of this, out of the which, he hath deliuered you long ſince, a benefit which you muſt alwayes haue before your eyes.

               <p>They noted in theſe words the ſignification of ſome great and high doctrine pronounced in a choice place, in a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as a ſingular and high Law giuen by our Sauiour, ſitting and opening his mouth as the Doctour of doctours, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hertofore opened the mouth of his Angels and Prophets, openeth now his owne and ſpeaketh in perſon; not to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, but to thoſe whome he had ordained of the priuy Councell to his prouidence, the pillers of perfection, and the noble foundations of his Church; and that which they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in generall in this Preface, they did obſerue, in euery one of the eight clauſes which make this ſermon.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſaith: <hi>Happy are the poore of ſpirit,</hi>

                  <hi>for they shall poſſeſse the earth.</hi> This is the earth of the lyuing. This is alſo a paradoxe to the world, who eſteemeth aboue all other, thoſe that haue their choller and their hand ready at commaundement, and know how to be reuenged of their enemies, children and heires of the earth, but of the earth of the dead not of the liuing. The 3.

The 7.

The 8. Happy and thoſe that ſuffer perſecution for iuſtice, for to them appertaineth <hi>the Kingdome of heauen.</hi> This laſt clauſe encountreth right with the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, who put their felicity in the friendſhip, fauours, and countenance of men, and accounteth him accurſed that ſuffereth perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ieſus-Chriſt therfore opening his mouth hath controled the falſe opinion of the world, and ſheweth how honourable a thing it is, to ſuffer for the honour of God, and that by his practiſe fortifyed the proofe of this his para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe, hauing himſelfe choſen labours, perſecutions, the death of the Croſſe, the toppe &amp; height of all perſecution; &amp; heere <hi>Lazarus</hi> concluded in theſe words.</p>

               <p>O ſweete Ieſus excellent teacher of truth, and truth it ſelf,<note place="margin">The prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> giue me the grace well to vnderſtand thy doctrine, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily to practiſe it, to be poore in ſpirit, and rich in thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and aboue all, for thy loue to ſuffer the wants and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of this life, and with thee to be partaker of that hire which thy doctrine promiſeth in the other.</p>

               <p>THEIR deuotion ended the Hermite brought them to the chamber to take a litle refection for the neceſſity of their iourny. <hi>Lazarus</hi> for himſelfe and his companions ſayd, my good Father, we cannot eat, nor drinke hartily, except firſt we may enioy the performance of your promiſe, &amp; may ſee that Citty neerer, which yerſterday you ſhewed vs a farre off, and made vs wonder at the meruailous qualities you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted thereof; it is to early to eat yet, neyther can we haue a better breakfaſt at your hand, than the hearing of ſuch a leſſon. I remember well my promiſe (quoth the Hermite) &amp; I will acquit my ſelf, but it ſhall be in walking with you,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:16410:185"/> for I will be your companion ſome peece of the way, &amp; you ſhall be ſo much the forwarder on your iourny; giuing his benediction, he deuided the egs, which he cauſed to be ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the ſhell; and to giue them example, began himſelfe firſt. When they had done, which was ſoone; well (ſaith he) let vs now go on Gods name. The porter gaue him in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his ſtaffe of pear-tree to reſt himſelf on, &amp; ſhutting the doore after him, he went out with them, the ſunne being about an houre high.

                  </note> The founder is Self-loue, the eldeſt ſonne of rebellion. <hi>Two loues</hi> (ſaith one Saint) <hi>built two Citties: Sel-floue built that of the Diuell to the contempt of God. The Loue of God built the Citty of God vnto the contempt of our ſelues;</hi> and this is founded in heauen in the midſt of the Kingdome of God. Hee of it is that <hi>Abell</hi> the firſt member of that Citty, built no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vpon the earth,<note place="margin">Why A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell built no citty but Cain.</note> becauſe he was a Pilgrime &amp; <hi>Cain</hi> the firſt reprobate and cittizen of Satans Citty, and of the world built a towne therin. This citty is a refuge of rebellion, a den of rake-hels, enemies to God, and preuaricatours of his law. Inſteed of walles it hath deep ditchs, and great rampires of earth, for that her defences are but bottoms and hils of errour and pride. The firſt founder made himſelf vaſſall and tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a Titant; for Selfeloue, &amp; all the burgeſſes of that citty are alwayes rebels to God, &amp; tributary to the Diuell; him they haue loued, to him they haue bowed their knee, though a tyrant of all tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; the moſt cruell that euer was; &amp; ſeeke
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:16410:185"/> help of him againſt their God.</p>
               <p>The fundamentall lawes of that Citty are thoſe fiue I tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before: the firſt, for each man to loue himſelf,<note place="margin">The laws of ſelfe-loue and the world</note> and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing for himſelfe: for the humour of the world &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, is to affect onely their owne particular profit, hauing clean baniſhed out of their hart, the loue of God, and their neighbour. The 2. to haue no Religion, to vſe and abuſe all for their temporall commodity: this is to too much verified by the experience of all the children of this world, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cuſtome is to make Religion a pretext of their deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to make vſe of the name of God for their owne glory; very hypocrites and ſacrilegious impoſtors.<note place="margin">To haue no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. To autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tize vice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue.</note> The 3. to caſt down vertue, and ſet vice aloft; according to this law, the world prayſeth thoſe that liue in delights, as moſt happy, and the pleaſures of the body, as the ioyes of felicity. It co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the couetous as prudent, to aduance &amp; further their own affaires.

And as the Kingdom of God is peace and charity, and his ſpirit is to nouriſh and mainteine peace, ſo the Kingdome of the Diuell, &amp; the eſtat of the world is trouble &amp; hatred, &amp; the ſpirit of the world is to make diſcord when there is queſtion to do euill.<note place="margin">To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> The 5. is to entice &amp; deceiue men by the promiſe of riches &amp; honours, which paſſe &amp; vaniſh: ſo many abuſed do perceiue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to dy, though late, that all they haue gotten is but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes &amp; dreames.<note place="margin">

Theſe are the lawes of this world and of this Citty.</p>
               <p>And as her lawes are but diſorders, ſo is her fayth perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,

Caſt the eyes of your memory, vpon the hiſtories of all ages paſſed; how many gallants hath ſhe precipitated into confuſion, after they had a while runne the race of their vanity in the ſight of men? How many hath ſhe moſt miſerably ſtrangled, that had to her performed moſt faithfull ſeruice? Was there euer any that more honoured or better ſerued her, then the <hi>Aſſuerus, Caeſars, Alexanders, Pompeies, Neroes, Diocletians, Decians,</hi> and other like Princes and Lords of her Court, great admirers of her maieſty, ſighing, ſeeking, nor breathing any thing els, but her greatnes; hath ſhe not made them all dye death euerlaſting? Thouſands ſee this at euery moone, and euery day, but the world is ſuch a coſener, that it bereaueth mortall men of their ſenſes, and men are ſo fooliſh and ſimple that ſtil they ſuffer themſelues to be ſeduced by her gaudies, &amp; preſent delights, ſo that they honour and ſerue her as their ſoueraigne Lord, not able to open their eyes to behold eyther the misfortune of others, or their own danger, nor their eares to heare the voice of the iuſtice of God who threatneth them;<note place="margin">The good mixed with the bad in this world</note> and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in ſuch ſort vntill they be ouerwhelmed in the ditches of their enemie, without help or hope euer to come out. Now God, who is our ſoueraigne King will ruinate this Citty, &amp; raze it to the ground; for he muſt iudge the world &amp; drench the obſtinate, but becauſe there be diuers of his owne ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts amongſt theſe ſinners, as of <hi>Lots</hi> in <hi>Sodome,</hi> he doth not yet exterminate the world, but expecting in fauour of the good, and by patience inuiting ſinners to pennance in the tyme of mercy, not to incurre at the day of iudgement, the ſeuerity and rigour of his eternall iuſtice. This is the Citty of which I told you yeſterday, &amp; out of the which by the grace of God you haue beene long ſince ſequeſtred, and ſhall be yet more, if you be good Pilgrims, as I eſteeme you. Thus did the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit expound his Allegory, often looking vp to heauen and ſighing. The Pilgrims heard him with great attention and contentment, &amp; their way ſeemed ſhort. <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſeeing him hold his peace, ſayd vnto him. My reuerend Father, you
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:16410:186"/> haue ſet before our eyes, a wholſome picture of the Citty of this world, and of the vanities of worldly men, &amp; you haue bound vs in eternall benefit: we deſire to be bound vnto you alſo for your praiers, and to obtaine for vs of our Lord, that as he hath already drawn vs from the ſnares of this deceifull world, ſo that he would giue vs grace to perſeuer vnto the end in his loue and feare. He will do it (ſayth the Hermit) do only what is in you, walk on euery day from good to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like good Pilgrims: be perfect before him, and you ſhall come by Gods grace to your deſired country. The B. Virgin whome you ſerue will help you with the aſſiſtance of her praiers, the holy Apoſtles, our good Fathers the Hermits, <hi>S. Iohn, S. Paul, S. Anthony, S. Hilarion, S. Bruno,</hi> and others who haue trampled vpon the world with the feet of conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, lyuing in the deſerts as Pilgrims vpon the earth, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you ayd happily to finiſh your courſe. You haue yet ſom way to diſpatch and ſome croſſes to endure, you ſhall paſſe not without paine and trauaile, but with the profit of your ſoules. As for you <hi>Lazarus,</hi> you ſhall be lamented of many, and your funerals ſhall be kept before your death, and thoſe that ſhall moſt mourne for you, ſhall be moſt comforted in your fortune; and that you may the better remember what I haue foretold you, keep this; and gaue him a litle paper folded like a letter, conteining theſe foure verſes.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>At that fayre Day, the last which you deſire,</l>
                  <l>Two dead reuiu'd without death shall ech other ſee;</l>
                  <l>And being ſeene, after their funerals kept,</l>
                  <l>Shall to the world then dye, to heauen reuiue.</l>
               </q>
               <p>As the Hermit ſaid theſe things, and they entred further within the wood a great lion came vpon them with moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible roring: the Pilgrims and the good porter were ſeized with an extreme feare, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> thought this had been the day of his funerall: but the Hermit knew preſently, that it was the Diuell in likenes of a lion, he made the ſigne of the Croſſe, and the lion vaniſhed. Then they came to a litle O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory of <hi>S. Anthony,</hi> whither this good old man was wont to walke his ſtation; where kneeling downe, and ſaying <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noster,</hi> and <hi>Aue,</hi> and demaunding the interceſſion of the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:16410:187"/> Saint, he aduertiſed them, to take the right hand when they were out of the wood and to lodge if they could, at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of the Charterhouſe monks called <hi>Bon-heur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of Bon-heur</note> which was ſix leagues of, and weeping he kiſſed them all three, and bad them farewell with his benediction, as they did him and his companion with a thouſand thanks. After they had done the deuotions of the day, they kept ſilence a while walking on: <hi>Lazarus</hi> thought of that the good Hermit had told him of his funerals, as alſo vpon the verſes written in the paper. He thought that his funerals ſhould be the lamentation of them who would be grieued that he ſhould dye to the world, in leauing it, and that the ſame afterward ſhould be comforted; but he was troubled to penetrat the ſenſe of the verſe, yet he did interpret the laſt day, the death which he ſo much deſired if it were the good pleaſure of God, but he could not accord the reſurrection of the dead without dying, nor their fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. How, ſaith he, ſhall the dead ſee one another, after their funerals? It ſhall be then in heauen after they are dead vpon earth: ſuch a ſenſe did he finde, for theſe foure verſes. When they had walked ſomwhile without ſaying a word, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to diſcourſe of diuers things pleaſant and pious. <hi>Vincent</hi> had alwayes ready in his mouth, ſome pretty ieſt and often touched <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and ſo they marched all that day without diſturbance, but at night they found themſelues in a pecke of troubles. For being entred into a great forreſt, wherin they thought to haue ſeene the Conuent of <hi>Bon-heur,</hi> and hauing entred a good way in without fynding any iſſue, after many turnings and returnings, they were ouertaken with night, and muſt needs ſtaye, whereat they were much amazed, for they were very weary and faint, and had but one lofe and a litle wine left; and which troubled them moſt was, that they found themſelues in this ſolitary forreſt in euident danger of wolues and other wild beaſts. So vpon their knees, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended themſelues to God, and the glorious Virgin, to <hi>S. Iohn Bapt. S. Anthony, S. Bruno,</hi> crauing their help in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. In praying they ſeemed to heare a voice ſaying: Get vpon the tree. There were hard by diuers great Oakes, and two eſpecially very commodious to reſt vpon, and eaſy to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:16410:187"/> clime; they choſe one: <hi>Lazarus</hi> firſt made <hi>Theodoſius</hi> &amp; <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> aſcend, and helped them with his ſhoulders, and bad them tye a cord which they had, to a high branch of the tree to help himſelf vp after them; he reached them all their three ſtaues, and holding the cord he mounted laſt, claſping and clyming very nymbly: they placed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues as high as they could, about 20. foote from the ground, and found many branches of the greater boughs, which ſerued for formes to ſit or ſleep vpon without daunger: they eat a litle bread they had and ſome peares, and dranke the litle wine was left in their botle. The repaſt ended, <hi>Vince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> ſaid; now behold we are lodged at the ſigne of the oake &amp; the Sar, vpon a higher ſtage iwis by much, then we were foure dayes ſince in the green caſtle with the hare. But if it raineth what ſhall we doe? We wil doe (anſwered <hi>Theodoſius</hi>) as they doe in <hi>Normandy.</hi> And what doe they there, replied <hi>Vincent?</hi> They let it raine, quoth <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> After ſuch prety deuiſes of honeſt recreation, they ſayd their Litanies by hart, made their examen of conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſayd their beads, and commended themſelues to the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God, the B.

At the end of the place one, vpon a banke raiſed of earth as vpon an Altar, made a ſacrifice in deriſion (as may be thought) of that which is don in the Church of God. <hi>Vincent</hi> would haue cryed out, but <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſtopped his mouth with his hands, and bad him in his eare commend himſelfe
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:16410:188"/> to God and ſit ſtill. And although neither the Goate, nor his Synagogue tooke any heed of the preſence of theſe Pilgrims (as God would haue it) yet they felt the effect of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: for they could not performe to their mind their charmes and abominations, and ſtayed many times looking about, if they could diſcouer any perſon, that might trouble them. At laſt the goate liſting vp his head perceiued the three Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims vpon the Oake: all the dance was daſhed, and all their action at an end, and ſodainly he diſpatched vnto the oake three of his troope, to whome he gaue the figure of Wolues, who came ſtraight to the foore of the tree, lifting vp their heads towards the Pilgrims. The Pilgrimes looked downe ſadly vpon them againe without ſaying word, not thinking that they would come vp to them: but when they ſaw them clyme like cattes, and come almoſt to reach them, they ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly made the ſigne of the Croſſe, &amp; all three cried out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as loud as they could, <hi>Ieſus Maria,</hi> at which voyce the wolues fell downe vpon the earth like three ſackes of corne, and all the aſſembly vaniſhed, leauing behind them a ſmoke &amp; ſtench moſt horrible, as if the plague had there burnt al the rags of her infection. Then ſayd <hi>Vincent,</hi> neuer in my life was I ſo high mounted to ſee ſuch dauncings, and ſuch a parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t meeting of ſtates or holding of eſtate, and if we be out of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I ſeeke at leaſt (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) to be attentiue, to that I would meditate. I ſee (quoth <hi>Theodoſius</hi>) that I was not vagabond all alone: were you diſtracted too (ſayth <hi>Lazarus?</hi>) much more than <hi>Vincent</hi> I doubt me, quoth <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> well God pardon vs our faults, replyed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> &amp; giue vs of his grace; I haue had my part of affliction alſo, for I could meditate nothing to the purpoſe no more than you: It is Gods prouidence to let vs ſee, how litle we can performe of our ſelues without his help, to the end to humble vs in the acknowledgment of our nothing: but let vs not looſe courage for this, for if hauing done our diligence to prepare our ſelues, we haue not taſted the ſweet hony of deuotion, we ſhall in humbling our ſelues find the profit of the ſowre, which is more to be deſired; for humility is more profitable and neceſſary to him that praieth and more pleaſing vnto God than ſpirituall ſweetnes;<note place="margin">Humility better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſweetnes of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and if the Diuell in deſpit of being driuen away by vs this night, will reuenge himſelfe by theſe myſtes which he caſteth into our fantaſies (God permitting him for our exerciſe) he ſhall yet receiue confuſion by our patience and profit.

For as in the Creation God made in him an abridgment of all nature, ſo ſhall he in their bodies riſen againe make an abridgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al the corporal beauties of the ſame nature. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius</hi> hearing this diſcourſe of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Alas (ſaith he ſighing) if men thought of this Reſurrection, what would they not doe to obtaine it? And if they make ſo great account of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and braue apparell, and of wearing ornaments which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the body, and yet belong not vnto the body, how ſhould they eſteem the glorious array of this future Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which ſhall be infinitely more beautifull, which ſhall be proper, and affects to the body, and ſhall laſt for all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

They came quickly thinking the wolfe would haue deuoured him, and were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed that he ſtirred not at their ſight and comming. The poore man lifting vp his head, as much as he could, &amp; ſeeing men there: maiſters (ſayth he) haue pitty on me, I am well, God be thanked; keepe the wolfe that he eſcape not, tye him with ſome corde, I haue him faſt by the foote. <hi>Lazarus</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drew a corde out of his bagge, and tyed it very hard about the beaſtes foote, and gaue him <hi>Vincent</hi> to hold, and with <hi>Theodoſius</hi> looſed this poore Patient; who as ſoone as he had his armes free, embraced <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> calling him by his name. O <hi>Syr Theodoſius,</hi> my good friend (ſayth he) what prouidence

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Tristram</hi> was looſed <hi>Theodoſius</hi> caſt his cloke about his ſhoulders, and hauing learned of him that a ſmall league of, there was a poore labourers houſe called <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-ſeul,</hi> where Pilgrimes did ſometimes lodge, they went thither to bed, but <hi>Vincent</hi> remembred himſelfe, that to lead the wolfe the more ſurely, he muſt put a gagge in his mouth, which they did, couching him vpon the earth, &amp; opening his mouth by force, faſtening his necke to the ground, with a forke they had made of an oaken bow, and put alſo a rope about his necke, and ſo went towards <hi>Maiſon-ſeul,</hi> all ioyfull ſauing the wolfe, who was not accuſtomed to carry ſuch morſells in his mouth, not be led in a ſtring. The labourer was returned an houre before with his family from a village by, where they had heard Euenſonge, and was in a little or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard looking vpon certaine graffs, and ſeeing the Pilgrims, he came out ſtreight to entertaine them, perſuading himſelfe that they went to ly there that night; and when he ſaw the wolfe gagged, &amp; a cord about his necke; Gallant (quoth he) you are not thus dreſſed for your good deedes. The children &amp; ſeruants ranne out of the houſe to behold this beaſt, who kept ſilence with great modeſty, but aboue all it was good ſport to ſee the intertainement with which the labourers dogges receiued him, yelping and bauling about him with full mouth, and ſhewing their teeth neerer then he well liked of, thogh they durſt not come to neer by reaſon of the gag which frighted them. The labourer endeaoured to appeaſe them, ſaying they muſt haue compaſſion on priſoners, but he was faine to ſhut him vp, els they had giuen him but hard intertaynement. The labourer commaunded a good fire to

                  </hi> did accommodate himſelfe by the fire, they made their exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of conſcience, and ſayd ſome prayers of thankes-giuing, and ſupper being ready they went ſoone to it, ſayd grace &amp; began to fall to their meat and talke. Good <hi>Triſtram</hi> did his part well, for he had eaten nothing all day, &amp; told what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes had befallen him, ſince he parted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Theodoſius</hi> not with a continued relation, but brokenly and by peece meale, and did not ſatisfy the eares of the Pilgrims with counted mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, but rather got them a ſtomake and appetite to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the whole; therefore when they had ſupped &amp; than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> as moſt familiar with him ſayd; Friend <hi>Triſtram,</hi> I pray you tell vs at length what hath happened to you and your companions ſince Munday laſt,<note place="margin">Triſtram recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his fortune.</note> and how you came into that eſtate we fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d you in? <hi>Lazarus</hi> our good guide deſireth it, and ſo do we both: You ſhall do me great honour (quoth <hi>Tristram</hi>) to le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d your eares to the narration of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; I ſhould deſire you to heare me, and you commaund me to tell it. And this is the leaſt ſeruice that I can afford your friendſhip: and for mine old companions, I weene they be all dead by this, or in poore eſtate, for our Captaine was in an encounter with 20. archers or thereabout, and was killed the ſixt; they would haue taken him aliue, but he defended himſelfe ſo couragiouſly, that they could not haue him but dead; his ſouldiours were all taken, except ſome few that ſaued them ſelues by flight, as my ſelfe: I vnderſtood ſince by one who was hidden in the wood, that the Prouoſt gaue charge to the Archers, that if they found one called <hi>Tristram,</hi> they ſhould bring him to him, without doing him any harm. As he ſayd this, <hi>Lazarus</hi> looked vpon <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> as ſhewing him the effect of his commendation to the Prouoſt. <hi>Triſtram</hi> following his diſcourſe; ſeeing my ſelfe (ſayth he) at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which I ſo much deſired, I thought how to accompliſh the vow, which I haue made by your good counſell, and to go in Pilgrinage to our Lady of <hi>Loreto,</hi> I trauailed three or foure dayes to get me more out of ſight and knowledge, and
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:16410:207"/> came to <hi>Florée,</hi> &amp; paſſed cloſe by this houſe. I ſold my horſe and my weapons, and made a litle mony wherwith I bought me a Pilgrims ſtaffe and a botle, and walked a foote as a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime, and yeſterday early in the morning I began my iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I had not gone a league, but I fell into the hands of ſixe theeues of thoſe that now courſe the country &amp; high waies, whome I tooke for merchants. They asked me, whither I went, thogh they might haue known that by my ſtaffe; they asking if there were any ſouldiours in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, &amp; whence I came: I anſwered to all their queſtions, and at laſt they came to the point, and asked if I had any mony: I told them that Pilgrims are not commonly much loden therewith that they may walke the lighter. Then one of them ſayd vnto me, Follow vs good Pilgrime, &amp; led me to the place where you found me; they rifled me and found about 20. crownes, and made me put of all my apparell vnto my ſhirt: there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned no more, but to take away my life, which they had once determined to do, for feare that I ſhould haue diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them; ſome would haue ſtabbed me, but one oppoſed himſelfe &amp; gaue aduiſe in apparence of humanity, but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect full of cruelty; which was to tye my handes and feete to foure ſtakes ſticked in the ground, my face to heauen ward as you found me, and there to let me dy eyther languiſhing of my ſelfe, or to be deuoured of wolues, which were there in great aboundance: they did execute their deliberation, and leauing me ſo bound they went their wayes: within one houre the wolues fayled not, following the winde, to come thither: there came firſt one alone, and came within 7. or 8. paces of me, and from thence barked on me a while; then he walked once or twice about, and ſate him downe, looking yet more attentiuely vpon me, to ſee if he could diſcouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſnare; at laſt he tooke courage to come cloſe to me, and as if he had beene ſure of his prey, he began to blow, with 4. or 5. great howlings, wherewith he called his companions, who harkened for a ſigne, &amp; vnderſtood it ful well. In the meane tyme he went about me to chooſe his blow and his bite, and becauſe he durſt not venture his head without good caution nor breath ouer me with his ſnout without good
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:16410:207"/> aſſurance (for it is a beaſt very ſuſpicious and diſtruſtfull as you know) he turned his taile to my face: Trow you, what trances I was in, lying ſo bound, with ſuch a ſquier of my body by me? And how hartily I comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded my ſelfe to God? When he had turned himſelf inough, and ſwinged his tayle twice or thrice ouer my face, he ſet his hinder foote in my right hand, of the which, as alſo of my left hand, I could help my ſelfe by mouing my fingers, for I was tyed by the wreſts: My good Angell put it in my mind to hold faſt his foote, if he ſet it there againe: he failed not to do it, nor I to take hold of it, and graſpe it as hard and faſt as I could, and in ſuch ſort that perceauing himſelfe to be taken, he pulled his legge as hard as he could, but he durſt not turne his head for feare of being entrapped more: I held him as God gaue me ſtrength, and me thought my fingers had neuer more force, and the more myne enemy was aſtoniſhed, the more was I encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. In the meane time came foure other great wolues, which were thoſe whom he had called with his houling, who came with good deuotion to take part &amp; feed of what they ſhould finde. They found me eaſily and came neer, but when they ſaw their ſpy ſet faſt in the ſtockes, and that he laboured in vaine to get himſelf out, they ran away through the woods, as if they had beene chaced and purſued by a whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of hunters: my wolfe ſtayed ſtill with me, thinking more how he might eſcape himſelfe then how to take me. Thus I remayned with him, neyther knowing how to hold him, nor yet to let him go, and was as much troubled to hold my wolfe by the foote, as are they that hold him by the eares. At that inſtant came you in good tyme to be my deliuerer:<note place="margin">Hold the wolfe by the eares</note> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the diuine goodnes, to giue me grace and force, to thanke him of this his ſpeciall prouidence, and to do vnto you ſome ſeruice, worthy of this benefit. Loe this was the hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Surely (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) it is notable, and declareth a great fauour of God towards you, hauing deliuered you from ſo eminent a danger, &amp; towards vs alſo, hauing brought vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this wood, to contribute our diligence to your deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> eſpecially muſt fynde himſelfe greatly bound

               <p>Truly (quoth <hi>Theodoſius</hi>) he bound me by his friendſhip to pray for him, which I haue done, and will continue, and render vnto God immortall thankes for this benefit; and you <hi>Syr Triſtram,</hi> ſhall fill vp my ioy and my companions, when we ſhall vnderſtand that you haue happily performed your vow which you made to the B.

And I haue ſuch hope in the helpe of the glorious Virgin, whome I ſerue, (alas what ſay I?) at leaſt whome I deſire to ſerue, that ſhe will obtaine me the grace, to attaine my deſire: Your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will help me much, and I ſhall haue an immortall band to pray vnto the diuine bounty, to render you a worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his owne hand, for the benefits which he hath giuen me by yours: Thus they paſſed the euening; after they retyred themſelues to one of the chambers, where they ſaid Litanies togeather, after which <hi>Triſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>AT three a clocke in the morning when no body was vp ſauing ſome ſeruants that went to labour, the Pilgrims began their meditation a part. <hi>Lazarus</hi> the firſt in feruour and heat of ſpirit began in admiration, wondering that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour aſcended into heauen, and left his glorious mother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt mortall men, ſeeing he knew well that ſhe ſhould be in continuall griefe for his abſence, and longing for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and that ſhe deſired nothing more, then to go out of this vale of miſeries, and to be with him, and there was not any creature, more worthy of heauen, and of his company then ſhe was.<note place="margin">Why the B Virgin was left on earth after the Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Sauiour.</note>

               <p>But the heauenly light ſhewed vnto him in the progreſſe of his meditation, that the Almighty, and all wiſe Sonne of God, did herein ſhew a ſingular prouidence, for the good of his moſt honourable mother, and of all his whole Church; for if the ſcripture reporteth that for a great fauour which is ſayd of the luſt, that God hath honoured him in making him labour, and hath accompliſhed his trauailes, this was a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prerogatiue, and a great honour which our Sauiour did to his mother to leaue her ſomtime after him in this life, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to ſhew &amp; employ her vertues,<note place="margin">The B; Virgin was left as the moone when the Sunne was gone</note> which hitherto had beene in a manner hidden vnder the cloake of profound humility knowne onely to God, and to few men beſides, &amp; by a thou ſand goodly workes wrought in publicke, make her multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the vſury of her merits vnto the higheſt heape and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and ſo much to increaſe the glory of her felicity.

I beſeech you remember me in your holy prayers, as long as I ſhall be Pilgrime in this world, I will carry in my hart the ſweet memory of our cordiall and faithfull friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Hauing ſayd thus, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> taught him, how he ſhould carry himſelfe in his pilgrimage, how to pray and confeſſe, and to vſe other exerciſes of deuotion, which <hi>Triſtram</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a wonderfull greedineſſe, and both beginning to weepe, they imbraced ech other. <hi>Tristram</hi> came after to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> &amp; thanked him with a great affection for all his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies. <hi>Lazarus</hi> agayne confeſſed himſelfe obliged vnto him for his friendſhip and fauours afforded to his Couſin <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> in priſon, and in recompence thereof promiſed him all the ſeruice he could do him in France, or els where as occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be offered. <hi>Tristram</hi> thanked him very humbly, and made a reciprocall offer whereſoeuer he ſhould meet him, &amp; then imbraced him, and ſo did <hi>Vincent. Lazarus</hi> put about his necke a payre of beades like a ſcarfe for a noble chayne, and gaue him three crownes, the better halfe of their <hi>Viaticum. Triſtram</hi> tooke the beades as an honourable preſent, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the mony, ſaying that it appertained not to Pilgrims to giue almes, and ſeeing he was a Pilgrime he would begge. At leaſt (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) Pilgrims may take it, when it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, and therfore you ſhould not refuſe it at our hands. Take it further, addeth <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> in title of neceſſity, for you are not only a Pilgrime, but a ſpoiled Pilgrime: <hi>Triſtram</hi> reaching forth his hand, well then (quoth he) now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to be a hardy Pilgrime, &amp; tooke it. The hoſt alſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with compaſſion offered his almes, and gaue him a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bagg to put his ſmall moueables in, and three manchets,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:16410:211"/> a little cheeſe, &amp; a Pilgrims ſtaffe which he had carried once before to <hi>Loreto,</hi> with a litle botle; &amp; ſo <hi>Triſtram</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in an inſtant armed for a Pilgrim at all points. The wolf they brought remayned priſoner with the Loſte, vntill he could pay his ranſome; They imbraced agayne, and taking a long farewell followed euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his way. <hi>Tristram</hi> towards <hi>Italy</hi> for <hi>Loreto,</hi> and the Pilgrimes into France, to which they had but three houres iourney, and but one dayes iourney to the houſe of <hi>Lazarus</hi> Father.</p>
               <p>Marching thus couragiouſly they came about noone to a little houſe at the entry of a Forreſt, in the which being a little refreſhed they continued their way through the ſame forreſt, &amp; hauing entred about a mile, they ſaw a Hart run a great pace without any body following, and but halfe his head, the want whereof made him both aſhamed and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as fynding himſelf diſarmed: halfe a league off they heard certaine hallowings &amp; gallopings of hunters, mingled with the cries of dogges, which made them vnderſtand the cauſe why this Hart diſlodged hold ſo out of ſeaſon, and before he had caſt his whole head and renewed his hornes. Paſſing a little further they ſaw a great kennell of hounds, and many ſet in relayes in diuers ſtations, and they knew by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and attendance, that it was ſome great Lord that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, coniecturing that it was the Marqueſſe of that country there, a Lord very courteous and Catholike, (although he was beſet with diuers of the pretented Reformation) and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly deuout to the B. Virgin, and charitable towards the poore. He had three ſonnes meruaiſlouſly well bred, &amp; brought vp to all ſorts of honeſt exerciſe, namely of armes &amp; of hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting: The yongeſt was gone to the bath with the Lady Marqueſſe his mother; the eldeſt who was called the Vicou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, remained in the Caſtle to diſpatch ſome matters with the Abbot of <hi>S. Leo</hi> his vnckle: his yonger brother, who was called the Baron, being about twenty yeares of age accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied his Father. He was a gentleman of excellent perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, &amp; of more excellent ſpirit, hauing beene of long time inclined to ſerue God, in a religious eſtate, though euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudged him more fit for the warre, and for the world. The
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:16410:212"/> beaſtes that were chaced in this hunting, were principally two great wild bores, the one whereof was liuely purſued by the dogs, the other hauing eſcaped gayned ground whilſt his companion buſied both dogs and hunters. The Baron went a ſide out from the company, without being perceiued, and driuen with a youthfull heat, ſet himſelfe to follow at the heeles of the bore eſcaped, with his ſword in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: he was mounted vpon a double curtall, &amp; encountred the beaſt iuſt by the way where the Pilgrims paſſed, and ſeeking his aduantage going about the bore, he ſtrake him on the left legge, meaning to haue ſtriken him on the right ſide without danger of his horſe. The bore turning himſelfe to the right ſide of the horſe whence he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he was ſtrike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, gaue him ſuch blowes within the belly, with ſuch a fury, that he burſt againe, the horſe fell downe ſtreight, and the Baron vnder him, the bore ruſhed to haue killed him, had not <hi>Lazarus</hi> &amp; his companions run quickly (for they thought it was an office of neceſſary charity) who with their ſtaues enuironed the beaſt, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſo watched him, that he ſtroke him to the hart a deadly wound with the pike of his ſtaffe, and ſent him fifty paces off to dye: they lifted the yong gentleman from vnder his horſe, and found he had no hurte. He beheld with a very attentiue and gracious eye the Pilgrims and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and could not forbeare to imbrace him, ſaying, My good friend Pilgrime, next vnto God I owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you my life <hi>Lazarus</hi> anſwered, God be bleſſed Sir, al goeth well, ſeeing there is nothing loſt but the horſe. In the meane tyme diuers of the company that miſſed their yong maiſter, came to the place, and ſeeing his horſe lye dead, they ſet him vp vpon another; and the Pilgrims did ſteale away the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron not perceiuing being compaſſed with his men. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe meruailed what was become of his people, and knew nothing of the daunger his ſonne had incurred. As he went this way and that way, he met a poore country fellow with a ſtaffe in his hand. Friend (quoth he) thou ſhalt do well to gett out of the way, leſt my dogges do thee ſome harme. Sir (quoth the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) I can ſay certaine verſes of the ſeauen pſalmes, with the which I will arreſt them well inough:
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:16410:212"/> he had no ſooner ſayd ſo, but fiue or ſixe great dogs ranne with open mouth vpon him: he got him ſelfe to an hedge, and the dogges followed him; he threw at them three or foure ſtones, which (foreſeeing the danger) he had put in his boſome; and ſtrake the boldeſt of them ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ud ly vpon the breaſt, as he ranne away crying and howling, and the other dogs ſet vpon him as their manner is, leauing the poore man who ſtirred not. One of the hunters wroth that his dog was ſtriken, went to bumbaſt the fellow: but the Marqueſſe ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, Soft and fayre (quoth he) is it not lawfull for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to defend himſelf? &amp; checking the poore man, Good fellow, quoth he, are theſe the verſes of the pſalme, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you arreſt the doggs? Sir (quoth he) I did ſay them, but I was forced to caſt two or three ſtones among. The good Maqueſſe laughed, and commaunded them to looke wel to the dogs, that they did him no harme, and the poore fellow was very diligent to get ground, and runne out of the dogs dangers. The Baron was returned vnto the company, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing that his Father marked him, he ſayd; Sir you ſee me mounted vpon a new horſe, the other fell downe vnder my legs, and told him how the matter had paſſed, highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the Pilgrims. The Marques asked where they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O verily (quoth the Marqueſſe) you are very vngratefull for the benefit, and commaunded one of his Gentlemen to go ſtay them at the Caſtle in any ſort. The Caſtle was a league of, neere vnto a village where they did meane to lye. The firſt bore being killed, the hunters followed the chace of the ſecond, to do as much to him, but they found him dead in the wood, and a horſe dead by him. Surely (quoth the Baron) this is of a blow the Pilgrime gaue him; I neuer in my life ſaw man better handle his ſword agaynſt a wild bore, then this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime did his ſtaffe. The gentleman that was ſent to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> told them that
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:16410:213"/> he had commaundement to ſtay them by force. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> &amp; <hi>Vincent</hi> both were of opinion to ſtay, and ſo they went to the Caſtle, and were brought to the Abbot the Marqueſſe his brother. This was a man of great learning and of very good life. They kiſſed his hands, and after were led to the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, where they prayed a while. The Marqueſſe followed ſoftly with his ſonne, and the greateſt part of the gentlemen, leauing ſome behind who had put their Terriers into the ground to bolte a foxe. He came about ſupper tyme, and forgot not to aske for his Pilgrims. It was told him that they were praying in the Chappell; thither he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; hauing ſaid a <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> he ſayd vnto them very courteouſly; you are wellcome my friends; you ſhall if it pleaſe you ſup with vs in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of theſe yong Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; you ſhal be our gueſts this night; this houſe hath alwayes one chamber to ſpare for Pilgrimes.

Good Pilgrims (replied the Marqueſſe) deſerue more then this, but you will haue patience with vs, and ſaying this, he perceiued and marked in their countenance, certaine ſhewes of generoſity and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and in the ſpeach of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> a graue liberty &amp; ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and began in his hart greatly to eſteeme him, as alſo did all the company, and eſpecially the Baron.

The Almoner ſayd grace, and euery man fell to his meate. Many diſcourſes were of hunting of the Hart, of the Bore, of the Fox, of the Partridge, of the nature of dogge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; haukes. <hi>Lazarus</hi> did ſpeake litle, but marked all without being ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or aſtoniſhed, and perceiued the qualities and cariage of all the gueſts, and eſpecially of the Tutor, who had giuen many girds, to no purpoſe, and of animoſity againſt pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages; alwayes numbling ſomewhat, when they ſpake of any thing concerning the Catholike fayth, or the honour of the B.

The Marqueſse knew well the cuſtome of Italy, for in his youth, he had beene in diuers countries, but he looked vpon <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as praying him to gratify the Baron in that behalfe, which <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſeeing, ſayd ſmyling. <hi>Monſieur Baron</hi> feareth not to put me to ſuch an anſwer, as the ſcholler of <hi>Paris</hi> made when he returned to his Fathers houſe, and not knowing what they called a partridge in latin (for that his Father as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him) anſwered that they eate no ſuch birdes in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Shall I ſo anſwere you <hi>Sir,</hi> that Pilgrims eate no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, neyther trauelling in Italy nor els where, becauſe it is no meate for Penitents, and that I know not whether they ſerue them with their heads or without them in Italy? Heere the Tutour ſpake in his teeth: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you muſt eate no partridge maiſter Pilgrims. Yet I will ſay notwithſtanding (quoth <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>) that in mine opinion, you haue giuen the forme, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the queſtion ſhould be propoſed: for me thinkes it ſhoud be demaunded in ſpeciall why in France they ſerue in partrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges without their head, for it may be that els where, they ſerue them, as they do other foule, with all their parts and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:16410:215"/> members. The Abbot iudged this anſwere to be full of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and modeſty, yet not ſaying any thing; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſse alſo tooke it for no leſſe, &amp; looking vpon the Baron; you haue heere (quoth he) your demaund; for <hi>Monſieur Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> hath couertly ſignifyed, that in Italy they ſerue Partrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with their heads on, &amp; I confirme his ſaying; for I haue ſeene it ſo in diuers places. It remaineth then for me (replyed the Baron) to anſwere why, they are ſerued ſo in France? I anſwer becauſe they are broght without heads to the Cook. Euery man with this anſwere began to laugh. The Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who by chance ſtood behind the Baron, did maintaine this anſwere as very pertinent, hauing touched the true cauſe of that quality of ſeruice; for the partridges heads, being the hawkes fee, they giue it her, after ſhe hath flowne, to eate, &amp; the body without head to the Cooke to dreſse, but this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is proper onely to the tables of Gentleman, who fly the Partridge, though diuers afterward in imitation haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo, not knowing the cauſe or origin thereof. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nobility of Italy obſerue not this law ſo ſtrictly, therfore they haue not giuen occaſion to others to do as they do in France. The Baron was wonderfull glad of this good ſuccour, which his Faulconer had giuen to his anſwere, and the Marqueſse did approue it. <hi>Monſieur le Cime,</hi> would haue found out another cauſe, ſaying, that the head of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge was of euill diſgeſtion, and therfore they caſt it away as vnprofitable. Then, quoth the Phiſician, we muſt take of the feete, for thoſe are of worſe diſgeſtion, and if all that is ſerued in were good meate, then we muſt eate the Pheſants taile, &amp; the pecockes too: how ſay you <hi>Monſieur le Cime</hi> would you be ſerued with ſuch meate for your ſupper? The Tutour held his peace as in contempt. The Baron was glad that the Doctour had refuted this reaſon, for all this did fortify that which he had brought. The Marqueſſe was wel pleaſed with theſe litle skirmiſhes, ſo long as they were done without bitternes, but with modeſty for honeſt recreation. After this queſtion was decided, fruit was brought in, and ſupper being done, water was brought for their hands, the moſt part roſe from the table, ſauing ſuch as the Marqueſſe cauſed to
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:16410:215"/> abide, amongſt which were the Pilgrimes, and the Almoner ſayd grace, after which by the Marqueſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man tooke his place, without ſaying word, with great deſire to heare ſome thing of the Pilgrimes, ſpecially of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus.</hi> Wherfore <hi>Monſieur le Marqueſse</hi> ſayd vnto him; <hi>Sir</hi> you haue now heard our hunting and diſcourſes theron, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſes, and proper to our vocation, you are courteous and wiſe to excuſe all: if you were not wearied of your way theſe gentlemen would willingly heare ſome better thing of you, and mamely of the place ſo renowned from whence you come. <hi>Lazarus</hi> anſwered: Syr your diſcourſes were very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and honeſt, and very pleaſing vnto mine eares, as giuing me matter to admire the Creator in his creatures, neyther ſhal wearines let me from ſpeaking of <hi>Loreto:</hi> I haue another let that may hinder me more, which is mine inſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy; yet ſeeing it pleaſeth you I will ſay ſomewhat chuſing rather to be eſteemed vnfit then vnwilling to recount the wonders of God, or ſlow to ſatisfy your mind before ſo noble an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Theſe three or foure periods pronounced with a very good grace, made the eares of euery one attentiue, &amp; <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> began his narration. He recounted vnto them the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Loreto;</hi> how it was tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſported from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonia,</hi> from thence into <hi>Italy,</hi> into a forreſt; after vnto a hill, and finally placed in the high way, where now it is; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the wonderfull Conuerſion of diuers great Sinners who became great Saints, the admirable workes that God ſheweth there, euery yeare, euery moneth, yea almoſt eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, by ſea, by land, in ſicknes, in health, in diuers da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and neceſſities, and all by the interceſſion of the glorious Virgin, the mother of his Sonne; and diſcourſed a long time with ſuch weight of ſentences, and ſuch attention of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that it ſeemed he had made all the company inſenſible, ſo was euery one rauiſhed to heare and behold him, except <hi>Monſieur le Cime,</hi> who made mouths and faces ſtill, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall of miracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſeeing that they would not leaue him, and there was tyme inough, I will add (quoth he) for the concluſion of my narration two miracles. The one is of a knight deliuered
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:16410:216"/> from the gates of death by the fauour and interceſſion of the B. Virgin. This knight was a gentleman of <hi>Catana</hi> very wealthy called <hi>Nicolas Pauonio,</hi>

The ſurgeons and phyſicians were fetched; after all the wounds ſerched and preſcriptions appointed, finally they condemned him to death. Then aduiſed by ſome of his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, who aſſiſted him, to call for the help of God, and to comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d himſelfe to our Lady of <hi>Loreto,</hi> he made a vow, that if by her interceſſion, God would reſtore him to his health, that he would go honour him as Pilgrime, and adore his Sonne in that ſacred Chappell. That vow being pronounced he ſlept, and it ſeemed to him in ſleeping, that our B. Lady preſented her ſelfe vnto him, and that touching him with her hand, ſhe had healed him; and awaking he found that his dreame was true, and that he was healed indeed; and went from thence to <hi>Loreto,</hi> and there rendred his vow and immortall thankes to God and his glorious mother.</p>

Euery man was rauiſhed with the memory, iudgement and eloquence of this Pilgrime hauing ſo well remembred and ſo faithfully repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all that had beene ſayd, and with ſo high a flight had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their earthly ſportes, to a ſenſe and rebound ſo ſpirituall and diuine. But aboue the reſt, the Baron had with his eares and hart deuoured his diſcourſe, &amp; ſpecially obſerued, what he ſayd of the knight hurt and healed by a vow made to our B.

Will you ſay they are ſuperfluous? Will you be wiſer and better aduiſed then God himſelf, to know better then he, what is neceſſary and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table? If you ſay they are not neceſſary to plant the fayth which is already planted, I anſwere, that if it were neceſſary to haue miracles to plant the fayth at the beginning of the Church among the Paynims, it is ſo ſtill amongſt the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims of the new world, where the fayth beginneth: and therefore it is that God doth them there: I ſay ſecondly that if amongſt Chriſtians, they be not neceſſary to plant the faith as at the beginning, yet they are for other effects: They are to manifeſt the glory of God, his power, his prouidence, his mercy, his iuſtice, to ſhew alwayes as by ſome marke of note that he is maiſter of nature, and that he can do more then ſhe; to honour his Saints; to nouriſh and entertaine the fayth of his children; to confute hereſies, to conuert ſinners; al which effects haue followed the miracles which haue beene done at <hi>Loreto</hi> by the interceſſion of the B. Virgin, and els where by the interceſſion of other Saints. Is it not a thing neceſſary that God be glorifyed and ſinners conuerted and ſaued? But are not your miniſters wicked and vniuſt, to thinke that God will not do any miracle for the good of his Church, and yet will ſuffer Antichriſt to do lying miracles to the ruine of the ſame? who euer ſaw a Captaine ſo ill aduiſed, who hauing vndertaken the defence of a Fort, permitteth his enemy to batter to his vttermoſt, and yet himſelfe ſtirreth not, nor permitteth any other to moue to the reſiſtance and repelling of the enemy? Will Ieſus-Chriſt then permit, yea command that his Church ſhall be battered and aſſaulted with ſignes &amp; lying miracles by Antichriſt, which are the ſtrongeſt engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Diuell and will let him batter without once mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or working againſt him any true miracle for the truth Moreouer doth not your doctrine a notable iniury to the Church of God,<note place="margin">Miracles a note of the true Church.</note> to take from her the vſe of miracles which is one of the faireſt markes that ſhe hath alwayes had, to ſhew

The houſes of the Citty were all great palaces, built of Diamonds, Saphires, Topazes, &amp; other precious ſtones of admirable luſtre and variety, &amp; cut moſt artificially: for couerings or roofes they had the ſeeling of heauen-flaming, varying in colours like the rainebow.

                  <hi>Lazarus</hi> meditated firſt of the piety and deuotion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to our B.

Secondly he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered how <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> comming by the Prouidence of God the third day, and deſirous to honour the body of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, whome he could not ſerue at her deceaſe, as his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions did, was cauſe that they opened the ſepulcher, to giue him contentment, and to behold that ſacred treaſure layd vp in it, and that not fynding it there, they acknowledged the glorious Aſsſiption of the B.

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:16410:224"/> day, as ſhe was priuiledged with a thouſand graces all the courſe of her life. And thereupon came into his memory the prophecy of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> foretelling in theſe wordes the Reſurrection of the Sonne, &amp; of the mother,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.</note>

               <p>So it was meete that, that ſacred body which had brought forth life, ſhould not be ſwallowed by death, and giuen for a prey and foode to wormes; nor the matter of incorruption turne to aſhes; and that ſhe who had by priuiledge beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from originall ſin,<note place="margin">

               <p>THVS <hi>Lazarus</hi> ended his prayer, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Vincent</hi> ended then alſo, and had felt great inward ioy therein. The ſteward came early to their chamber, hauing made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy their breakfaſt, but they would eate nothing, ſaying it was to ſoone. They deſired him humbly to ſalute in their behalfe <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Marqueſſe, the Abbot, the Vicount, &amp; the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron his children, and to aſſure them that they would pray to God for their proſperity. The ſteward had cloſely put into <hi>Lazarus</hi> bagge ten Crownes wrapped in a paper, with theſe words of the Marqueſſe owne writing, Pray to God for the Marques; which <hi>Lazarus</hi> found at night in his fathers houſe. He imbraced the Steward with many thankes, &amp; after they had ſayd their Pilgrims prayers, they went out of the Caſtle, and hauing beene a while ſilent, they began to talke: <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> praiſed much the prudence and liberality of the Marques, and of his brother, the ſincere and harty loue of his children, full of humility and courteſy, the true markes of true nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as contrariwiſe pride and diſdaine is a true token of a baſe and rude mynd: he commended alſo greatly the modeſty &amp; diligence of all the officers and ſeruants, and tooke this for a ſure ſigne of the Marqueſſe his vertue, for commonly like maiſter like men, and the ſubiects doe for the moſt part frame themſelues, after the faſhions of their Lord. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſayd that he noted at ſupper a meruailous contentment of all in the anſwere that was made to <hi>Syre Cime,</hi> and that he did neuer better perceiue the leuity &amp; obſtinacy of hereſy, then in that man, who ſought nothing but to talke, and ſhew himſelfe, though he ſhewed himſelfe alwayes void of good learning.<note place="margin">Pride the Father of hereſy.</note> Whereupon <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſayd: Pride is the Father of hereſy, and vanity is her Miſtreſſe: and therefore you may not meruaile to ſee an Heretike both proud and vayne togeather. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:16410:226"/> then (quoth <hi>Vincent</hi>) doth not the Marqueſſe his nephew ſhew himſelfe like his maiſter?

Surely (ſayd <hi>Vincent</hi> I lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged much to haue told the Tutour, that he wanted a Head himſelfe, when he demanded of me, why partridges were ſerued without heads; I was not ſory (quoth <hi>Lazarus</hi>) that the queſtion of the head was propoſed, for the taile thereof proued good, and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had a doctour, who expounded his anſwere with an honourable gloſſe: ſurely (quoth <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi>) that fellow deſerued to be well payed, as he was, God giue him grace to know himſelfe. Diſcourſing in this ſort, the Pilgrims had diſpatched foure leagues which was more by halfe, then they had to the houſe of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Father, which was called the Caſtle, built neer vnto a towne; they came to a place called <hi>Bonuoiſon,</hi> where they dyned cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and would preſently haue beene gone, but that a chance ſtayed them: And that was, that there were two poore men ſicke in the Inne, who the night before had confeſſed, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded extreme-vnction, and euen now entred into the agony of death, hauing no body, that in ſo dangerous a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, might exhort them: for the Curate was gone to the obſequies, which that day were kept at the Caſtle. They thought that charity bound them, to aſſiſt vntill the Curate ſhould come, who (they ſayd) would returne preſently, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> tooke one in one chamber, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Vincent</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another chamber: and ſeeing that they had perfect memory, they exhorted them both. <hi>Lazarus</hi> exhorted his in this ſort.</p>

               <p>Behold then my requeſt grounded vpon two good titles, of the goodnes and will of God, and of your vertue and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit towards me: and this my deſire is, that for the honour of God whome your ſelfe honour aboue all things; and for the holy loue you beare vnto me, and haue ſhewed by a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d benefits, that it would pleaſe you to take in good part, that without any longer delay, I may leaue the world to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate my ſelfe to the ſeruice of him, who hath called me to follow him, and that giuing me your bleſſing, you would
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:16410:231"/> crowne with this benefit, all others that hitherto I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of you; all which I will remember whilſt my body ſhall breath, and for the which I ſhall demaund of God with warme teares, a recompence worthy of his diuine Maieſty. The manner of life which I ſhall chooſe, ſhall not make me leaue, or forget the loue and reſpect which I owe vnto you, but will make it more ſolide and firme: for the counſels of God, which teach vs to follow him neere, are not contrary to his law, which commaundeth to honour Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and Religion doth not deſtroy the law of nature, but doth purify, confirme, and increaſe it. And therefore thogh I ſhould be abſent in body, yet I ſhall be alwaies preſent with you in ſpirit, &amp; in what place ſoeuer the prouidence of God ſhall let me liue, I ſhall alwayes remaine your moſt humble Sonne and Seruant, and will put you in the beginning, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and end of my beſt prayers and deſires. And I haue full hope in the goodnes of him,<note place="margin">

And in this reſpect the prudence and piety of my well beloued brother, and my deereſt ſiſter ſhall ſupply all the want you may haue by my abſence. For you haue had good triall &amp; experience this ſeauen yeares that this houſe can well ſtand without me, and that your old age receiueth by their onely aſſiſtance, obedience, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all the ſeruice and ſuccour that a father may expect of his beſt children. And therefore I beſeech you, my moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Father, to heare my requeſt &amp; bleſſe my departure: &amp; ſaying this he caſt himſelfe at his feete.</p>
               <p>The good old man began to weepe a good while, and being ſomewhat pacifyed, cauſed his Sonne to riſe vp, and ſayd vnto him, with a graue and conſtant countenance: My Sonne <hi>Aime-dieu,</hi> thy words do ſhew, that thou haſt pitty and compaſſion of thy Father, and that thou wouldeſt part from me without violence: thou dooſt well and like a good child:

Know thou, my Sonne, that I haue beene now, long time prepared to conforme my ſelfe to the will of God, namely ſeauen yeares ſince thou wentſt in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage with thy brother <hi>Pauline,</hi> when togeather with him thou madeſt thy meaning knowen vnto me. I found ſome difficulty to reſolue my ſelfe; but at the laſt, this is my mynd and my reſolution; I am content &amp; glad that the will which God hath giuen thee to do well, and ſerue him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hart, hath continued in thee liuely and conſtant, &amp; ſhall be more glad to ſee thee happily effectuate the ſame. I thinke I cannot wiſh a better fortune, then to ſee thee in the ſeruice of ſuch a Lord, and that I cannot haue a deſire more worthy and fit for a Father, then to deſire thy ſaluation. The obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thou haſt to me is ſmall in it ſelfe, and nothing in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of that thou oweſt vnto God. Of me thou haſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of thy being, in the mortall ſeed of thy mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which being well conſidered is a thing of nothing, and ſhould indeed haue beene nothing, if the Almighty hand of God, had not giuen force to nature to forme thy members within in the wombe of thy mother; and all theſe members formed are but a lumpe of nothing, if he had not infuſed a ſoule, bearing his owne image and likenes to rule therein, to quicken and gouerne it; and finally that little I haue contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to thy generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the liberality of the ſame Lord: ſo that all being well deducted, it is God that hath giuen thee all thou haſt, and all thou art, and from him all thy goods do riſe; to his goodnes thou muſt returne duty and homage, and to me thou oweſt nothing but by the law of the ſame God, who commaundeth thee to honour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, in conſideration of what thou haſt recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of them. For the reſt, thou art all his, and if he had taken thee twenty yeares ſince or before from me or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this world he had done me no wrong, taking but his owne. And when
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:16410:232" rendition="simple:additions"/> theſe dayes paſt I had newes of thy death. I ſetled my ſelfe to a reſolution to thanke him for all, with the hope I concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that he had ſhewed mercy vnto thy ſoule, and hauing now conſerued thee in life and deſire to ſerue him, I haue the more to thanke him for the honour he doth me, calling thee to the ſeruice of his Altar: An honour much greater, then if thou wert called to the court of the greateſt Prince in the world. The care, paine, and charges that <hi>I</hi> haue beſtowed to bring thee vp in vertue, and to make thee worthy of a noble houſe, and which thou haſt learned in ſchooles, in warres, in thy peregrinations, are alſo gifts of his holy hand, and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Many Fathers will thinke my iudgment and opinion inhumane, but I am content that it is reaſonably and magnanimous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. If for my temporall commodities which I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of my children I ſhould hinder their vocation from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

Thou leaueſt not thy Father neyther, but doeſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him.

And if thou wilt ſerue God as a perfect ſeruant, who letteth thee to performe it in the houſe of thy father, whome God commaundeth thee to ſerue and honour? Of thy Father, I ſay, who hath alwayes giuen thee by his works and wordes good teſtimony that he caryeth the feare of God in his hart, and loueth vertue, and is pleaſed to ſee his children perfect in all piety?
